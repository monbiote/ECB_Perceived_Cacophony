She adds that there has been criticism of the course of monetary policy from the Portuguese Prime Minister, President and parties. Ms Sá Lopes stresses that while the  ECB  is pursuing a policy aimed at cutting wages, Portuguese banks have seen an opportunity to profit from rising interest rates.\n",

According to the authors' calculations, only 12% of these tax cuts and spending increases benefit vulnerable households; and less than 2% will directly contribute to the ecological transition. The probability that the need for compensatory measures extends to 2023 means that these measures will have to be altered. The increase in interest rates by the  ECB  may be a particularly painful and not very efficient medicine against the spiking prices since their origin is not an overheating of the  European  economy. More measures are needed: specifically, a reform of the energy price fixation mechanisms and an income pact.\n",

Mr Stehn also expects  ECB  officials to say that the September projections remain intact, but now with greater uncertainties due to the conflict in the Middle East. According to BPI Research, the  ECB 's meeting on Thursday would serve to confirm that interest rates reached their peak in September.\n",
      "110     An editorial argues that every month there is excitement around how long inflation will last when the German Federal Statistical Office (Destatis) announces the preliminary inflation figures, and it leaves no one untouched. The authors explain that it happened again on Friday: Destatis announced that inflation was 6.2% in July and the decline could be interpreted as all could be well and inflation will eventually calm down. However, that is not the case because core inflation, which the public does not pay much attention to, is still high. They note that soon core inflation will be higher than headline inflation, which is problematic because that is the part of inflation  central banks  can actually influence with interest rate hikes. Commerzbank Chief Economist Jörg Krämer has commented that the  central bank  will now look more and more at core inflation, which the authors say is a strategic turn. They conclude that marching into the second wave of inflation, core inflation will play a bigger role. \n",

The  ECB 's role in the euro area's debt-to-GDP ratio, influenced by the  ECB 's decisions, is under scrutiny in the reform of the Stability Pact. Collective decisions within the  EU  can affect member countries, particularly Italy, due to its high public debt and low economic growth. The debt-to-GDP ratio, which will be a focus of the Ecofin meeting on 8 December, points to these issues. Through interest rate decisions, the  ECB  impacted national debts with influence on price dynamics and real growth in the euro area economies through its monetary policy. The only entity that can jeopardise national debt is the  ECB  through wrong monetary policy, the author concludes.\n",

Mr Visco, however, defended the  ECB  from the attacks of those who criticised it as slow in recognising the arrival of high inflation in recent months and stressed that he does not see any apparent reason to assume that the upcoming increases will be extraordinarily high. The governor claimed that the  ECB  had started its journey last December and emphasised that the institution's neutral policy rate would be between 0.7% and 1.8%.

After the hail of declarations from the hawks, the Frankfurt leadership in recent days was slow in recognizing the arrival of high inflation in recent months. And the dust of the hawks' front is soaked in the ECB Council: There is no &lt;&lt;obvious reason why Tying Our Hands With Hypotheses of Extraordinarily High Increases Such as Those We Read in Some Parts. A Speech Made Highlighting the Difference Between Europe and the United States which requires a different normalization path. A similar vision is also expressed by the EU Commissioner for Economic Affairs Paolo Gentiloni who calls for fighting inflation \"without killing growth\". For the board of the central bank, a decision will also be made more difficult by the different pace of inflation in European countries, hidden within 10% of the EU figure. If Germany is at 10%, LANDA at 17% and Italy at 8.9%, in Spain prices are rising and so also in France, at +6.2%. In his speech, the Governor claims that the ECB has made its path neither accommodative nor restrictive and that Frankfurt is trying to achieve so as not to further fan the flames of inflation: 'It would be in a range between 0.7 and no rate hike. , orClose to Be Soon &gt;&gt;. Visco's is a clear stop to colleagues who are asking for new sharp increases in GNI. Decision will be made \"based on data\".

IT'S NOT ONLY GROWTH THAT IS VANTI'S TROUBLE FOR FINANCIAL STABILITY&gt;&gt;, the realization of which would have heavy repercussions in all the countries of the euro area, leading to a tightening of financial conditions far greater than what was considered appropriate to contain the high inflation. \"And also for this reason Italy must not abdicate its virtuous path on which Mario Draghi's government has set out: debt reduction. The message, without naming it, is to the new government.

       "      <td>He assures that we must not lower our guard and defends a restrictive orientation of fiscal policy already in 2024 MADRID, Jan. 2 (EUROPA PRESS) - The governor of the Bank of Spain and member of the Governing Council of the European Central Bank (ECB), Pablo Hernandez de Cos, is confident that the eurozone inflation rate will maintain the downward trend in 2024, although he warns that the pace of deceleration of price rises will be slower. \"In 2024 the decline in inflation would be slower due to upward base effects and the gradual withdrawal of the fiscal measures adopted during the energy crisis,\" points out the Spanish central banker in an article published in \"Anuario Espa\\\\xf1a 2024. A year by ahead,\" from EY Insights. In this sense, as Christine Lagarde already anticipated in her last press conference in December, the governor of the Bank of Spain warns that in the last month of 2023 there will be a temporary rebound in the inflation rate, after the escalation of Prices in the eurozone moderated to 2.4% in November. Thus, in the longer term, after this temporary rebound in December, the Eurosystem's projections point to a continuation of the downward trend in inflation, which is expected to converge to the 2% target in 2025. In this context, De Cos recalls that the Governing Council of the ECB decided to keep interest rates unchanged in December, with the conviction that if they remain at the current level for long enough, it is very likely that the inflation target will be achieved. 2% in the medium term. Likewise, it highlights that the errors in the entity's projections have been reduced in recent months and, in fact, inflation has been below expectations, while it is estimated that monetary policy continues to be strongly transmitted to conditions. of financing, even above what was expected. Regarding the question of how long it will be necessary to maintain interest rates at the current level, before beginning to gradually reduce them, the Spaniard defends that it will depend on the future evolution of the data in a context in which the level of uncertainty continues being elevated. In this way, although since last November market rates have been reduced sharply and are clearly below the path incorporated in the projections, while the prices of energy raw materials have been revised significantly to On the downside, De Cos warns that geopolitical developments, particularly in the Middle East, continue to pose a downward risk to growth and an upward risk to inflation. Furthermore, remember that the evolution of unit labor costs and business margins will also be crucial to determine the future behavior of inflation and the reaction of monetary policy, as well as the trend of fiscal policy. In this regard, it states that governments should reverse the support measures associated with the energy crisis and the orientation of fiscal policies should be restrictive already in 2024 and in the following years to gradually reduce the high levels of public debt and structural deficits observed. in some countries. \"In summary, the high level of uncertainty implies that we must remain very attentive and not lower our guard to promptly detect any risk that affects the inflation outlook,\" defends De Cos in order to avoid insufficient tightening, which would prevent the achievement of the inflation target, as excessive, which would unnecessarily harm activity and employment.</td>\n",

Analysts' estimates suggest that Spanish financial entities will announce combined profits of nearly EUR 26 billion, a 24% increase from the previous year. The profits of the country's three main banks: Banco Santander, BBVA, and Caixabank, alone will surpass last year's combined figures. This follows the  ECB 's interest rate hikes due to which the Euribor rate exceeded the 4% barrier, revaluing the credit portfolio of banks operating in Spain.</td>\n",

       "      <td>The shift in the monetary policy of the European Central Bank (ECB) has acted as tailwinds for the banking sector. The body led by Christine Lagarde adopted a more restrictive stance since July 2022, which has resulted in six new increases in interest rates for this year, placing them at 4.5%. As a consequence, the Euribor has managed to break the 4% barrier, revaluing the credit portfolio of financial entities operating in Spain. Added to this is that the remuneration of deposits has not taken off. All of this is the cocktail that will allow the banks listed on the Ibex 35 to present a record profit, despite the fact that they have had to face the extraordinary tax on the banking sector and increase 'somewhat' the piggy bank of provisions for a default that has not taken off. According to analyst estimates, collected by Bloomberg, the heavyweights of Spanish banking will announce a profit of almost 26,000 million (25,858.25 million euros), 24% more than a year ago when they earned 20,850 million euros, with increases in results of between 24 and 28%. But what's more, only what the three main entities in the country (Banco Santander, BBVA and Caixabank) will score will be enough to surpass last year's joint figures. Banco Santander will break the 10 billion euro barrier, a goal that the previous president, Emilio Botin, had set before the financial crisis stood in the entity's way. Specifically, analyst estimates place the net profit of the entity led by Hector Grisi at 10,777 million euros, thanks to the boost in interest margin that will exceed 43,000 million euros, which benefits from the rise in rates in Europe and its fall in Brazil. BBVA's results will continue to be driven by the business in Spain and Mexico. The entity chaired by Carlos Torres will benefit from the rise in interest rates in both regions and from the strong commercial activity in the Central American country. The combination of these two variables will make it possible to increase profits and exceed 7.7 billion euros, marking a new record after the one reached last year. The interest margin would reach 24,188.57 million euros, which represents an advance of 26%. The third in contention will be Caixabank. Its national presence and a business focused on the retail sector will allow it to present a profit of 4,864 million euros, and it is close to the 5,226 million euros obtained in 2021 when the merger with Bankia took place. The bank chaired by Jose Ignacio Goirigolzarri is one of the most benefited by the rise in interest rates despite the fact that it has also been the entity that has had to pay the most in the extraordinary tax on the banking sector. The interest margin would break 10,000 million euros. Banco Sabadell finds itself in this same situation. The bank led by Cesar Gonzalez-Bueno will consolidate profits of over 1,000 million euros, a figure it already reached in the third quarter of the year. Thus, with an interest margin growing by double digits, reaching 4,741 million euros. The net profit will reach 1,315.59 million euros. In 2022, the group reported profits of 859 million euros, 53% more. In 2022 it had already shot up its result by 62%. Bankinter, whose customer focus is on a higher financial profile, will also present a benefit not seen to date driven by credit revaluation and despite the fact that it is one of the entities that most rewards its customers' savings. Thus, the profit will be 865 million euros, above analysts' estimates at the beginning of the year. In 2022, the bank recorded a profit of 684 million euros, which means seeing the result also grow by 26%. Unicaja Banco will also reflect in its accounts the positive impact of the increase in interest rates. The interest margin will reach 1,330 million euros, while the profit will be 331.41 million euros, 28% more.</td>\n",

       "      <td>MADRID, 02 (SERVIMEDIA) The Governor of the Bank of Spain, Pablo Hernandez de Cos, claimed this Tuesday that European governments should \"reverse the support measures associated with the energy crisis\" and establish a fiscal policy whose orientation \"should be restrictive now in 2024 and in the following years to gradually reduce the high levels of public debt and structural deficits observed in some countries. This was indicated by the head of the institution in the article 'Inflation and interest rates in the euro area', published in the Yearbook 'Spain 2024. One year ahead', by EY Insights. Hernandez de Cos framed this request in the fight against inflation, stressing that reducing the deficit and debt is \"essential\" to prevent inflationary pressures from increasing, which would make \"an even more restrictive orientation of monetary policy\" necessary. With this objective in mind, I demand to reach an agreement \"soon\" on the reform of the economic governance framework of the European Union. In his analysis, he recognized that the euro area has experienced in the last two years the \"most intense inflationary episode in its history\" and, as a consequence, the response of monetary policy has also been \"very forceful, with a monetary tightening that \"It is unprecedented neither in its magnitude nor in its speed.\" De Cos attributed the slowdown in price increases in recent months to the evolution of the energy component and the lower pressures on supply chains, as well as to the impact of the tightening of monetary policy. Looking to the future, he recalled that the Eurosystem's projections reflect a continuation of the downward trend, which is expected to converge to the 2% target in 2025, although with a slower decline in 2024. Thus, after maintaining interest rates without variation in December, he noted that the European Central Bank (ECB) continues to assess that, if its current level is maintained for long enough, it is \"very likely\" that the 2% inflation target can be achieved \"in the medium term.\" . In this sense, he stressed that the recent evolution of inflation and the aforementioned projections \"support it\" and noted that they have gained \"confidence\" in these forecasts, given that the forecast errors \"have been reduced in recent months.\" Thus, De Cos indicated that \"the question of how long it will be necessary to maintain interest rates at the current level, before beginning to gradually reduce them, will depend on the future evolution of the data, in a context in which the level of uncertainty remains high\", thus closing the stage of interest increases by the ECB that began in the summer of 2022. UNCERTAINTY The governor of the Bank of Spain believes that a \"useful reference\" to know the future lies in the Eurosystem's projections for the month of November. The median of analyst expectations anticipated the first rate reduction for the beginning of the third quarter of 2024 and that at the end of 2024 the deposit facility rate would be around 3.25% and that in the long term it would reach 2%. Since then, however, he noted that market rates have been reduced \"markedly and are clearly below the path incorporated in the projections.\" Other assumptions have also suffered \"significant changes\", such as the prices of energy raw materials, which have been revised significantly downwards. However, geopolitical developments, particularly in the Middle East, continue to pose a downside risk to growth and an upside risk to inflation. Regarding economic growth, he recalled that the projections showed a new downward revision. Growth of 0.6% is expected in 2023, a slight recovery to 0.8% in 2024, and advances of 1.5% in 2025 and 2026, as the effects of monetary policy disappear. In any case, he stressed that the transmission of monetary policy has been \"surprising them with its strength\", which, if extended in the coming years, would translate into lower growth and inflation. SALARIES AND MARGINS On the other hand, I assure that the evolution of unit labor costs will also be \"crucial\" for the behavior of inflation. The projections incorporate a gradual increase in real wages, which would recover the loss of purchasing power observed in 2022 towards the end of 2024. However, I stressed that labor markets remain stressed, which could generate higher wage pressures, although the fall in the Inflation could also moderate wage demands. Regarding company margins, given the weakness of demand and the resolution of bottlenecks, a compression is expected, as has already happened in the third quarter, indicated De Cos, who noted that their future behavior will be \"crucial\" to assess its role as a buffer against wage pressures. \"The high level of uncertainty means that we must remain very vigilant and not lower our guard to promptly detect any risk that affects the inflation outlook. This way we can avoid both insufficient tightening, which would prevent the achievement of our inflation objective, and excessive, which would unnecessarily harm activity and employment,\" concluded the governor.

However, 2023 was also the year in which the debate turned to figuring out when in 2024 the first rate cut will be announced. Although the 2% inflation target has not been reached, the  ECB  is not expected to hike rates again.

Mr Visco, however, defended the  ECB  from the attacks of those who criticised it as slow in recognising the arrival of high inflation in recent months and stressed that he does not see any apparent reason to assume that the upcoming increases will be extraordinarily high. The governor claimed that the  ECB  had started its journey last December and emphasised that the institution's neutral policy rate would be between 0.7% and 1.8%. Therefore, the  ECB  could have already reached this rate with its last interest rate increase or is close to reaching it soon.   \n",

Uncertainty about the persistence of price pressures continues to call for a “robust control” approach to monetary policy, Ms Schnabel said in a speech in Spain. Such a stance reduces the danger that medium- and long-term inflation expectations move further away from the 2% target, she said. “A decline in real wages and a slowdown in aggregate demand may not materially ease current inflationary pressures,” Ms Schnabel warned, adding that further increases in the  ECB 's key policy rates will be needed. However, she noted that for now, “the risks of a wage-price spiral are contained, provided inflation expectations remain anchored.”   \n",

Echoing  ECB  President  Christine Lagarde 's previous statements, Mr Hernández de Cos warned of a temporary inflation spike in December 2023. However, the  ECB  decided to keep interest rates unchanged in December, confident that maintaining current levels would likely achieve the 2% inflation target in the medium term. Mr Hernández de Cos also warned that geopolitical developments, particularly in the Middle East, pose a risk to growth and inflation. Furthermore, he argued that governments should reverse support measures related to the energy crisis and adopt a restrictive fiscal policy stance from 2024 onwards to gradually reduce the high levels of public debt and structural deficits observed in some countries.   \n",

Although the 2% inflation target has not been reached, the  ECB  is not expected to hike rates again.

For this reason, it is not expected to cut rates earlier than spring 2024.   \n",

The Governor of the Bank of Italy, Vincenzo Visco, warns against rapid and pronounced risks >>. After the hail of declarations from the hawks, the Frankfurt leadership in recent days was slow in recognizing the arrival of high inflation in recent months. And the dust of the hawks' front is soaked in the ECB Council: There is no <<obvious reason why Tying Our Hands With Hypotheses of Extraordinarily High Increases Such as Those We Read in Some Parts. A Speech Made Highlighting the Difference Between Europe and the United States which requires a different normalization path. A similar vision is also expressed by the EU Commissioner for Economic Affairs Paolo Gentiloni who calls for fighting inflation \"without killing growth\". For the board of the central bank, a decision will also be made more difficult by the different pace of inflation in European countries, hidden within 10% of the EU figure. If Germany is at 10%, LANDA at 17% and Italy at 8.9%, in Spain prices are rising and so also in France, at +6.2%. In his speech, the Governor claims that the ECB has made its path neither accommodative nor restrictive and that Frankfurt is trying to achieve so as not to further fan the flames of inflation: 'It would be in a range between 0.7 and no rate hike. , orClose to Be Soon >>. Visco's is a clear stop to colleagues who are asking for new sharp increases in GNI. Decision will be made \"based on data\". In the last two days alone, the governors of Austria, Finland, Lithuania and Latvia had pushed the hawkish front in favor of a 75 basis point squeeze in October. IT'S NOT ONLY GROWTH THAT IS VANTI'S TROUBLE FOR FINANCIAL STABILITY>>, the realization of which would have heavy repercussions in all the countries of the euro area, leading to a tightening of financial conditions far greater than what was considered appropriate to contain the high inflation. \"And also for this reason Italy must not abdicate its virtuous path on which Mario Draghi's government has set out: debt reduction. The message, without naming it, is to the new government. Help to combat the energy shock and the expensive bills are possible but only to the most affected companies and families, otherwise the Count will be paid by future generations with the Greater Kingdom.   \n",

slowdown in Europe may not be enough to tame inflation, urging more increases in borrowing costs.

Such a stance reduces the danger that medium- and long-term inflation expectations move further away from the 2% target, she said.   \n",

A year by ahead,\" from EY Insights. In this sense, as Christine Lagarde already anticipated in her last press conference in December, the governor of the Bank of Spain warns that in the last month of 2023 there will be a temporary rebound in the inflation rate, after the escalation of Prices in the eurozone moderated to 2.4% in November. Thus, in the longer term, after this temporary rebound in December, the Eurosystem's projections point to a continuation of the downward trend in inflation, which is expected to converge to the 2% target in 2025. In this context, De Cos recalls that the Governing Council of the ECB decided to keep interest rates unchanged in December, with the conviction that if they remain at the current level for long enough, it is very likely that the inflation target will be achieved. 2% in the medium term. Likewise, it highlights that the errors in the entity's projections have been reduced in recent months and, in fact, inflation has been below expectations, while it is estimated that monetary policy continues to be strongly transmitted to conditions. of financing, even above what was expected. Regarding the question of how long it will be necessary to maintain interest rates at the current level, before beginning to gradually reduce them, the Spaniard defends that it will depend on the future evolution of the data in a context in which the level of uncertainty continues being elevated. In this way, although since last November market rates have been reduced sharply and are clearly below the path incorporated in the projections, while the prices of energy raw materials have been revised significantly to On the downside, De Cos warns that geopolitical developments, particularly in the Middle East, continue to pose a downward risk to growth and an upward risk to inflation. Furthermore, remember that the evolution of unit labor costs and business margins will also be crucial to determine the future behavior of inflation and the reaction of monetary policy, as well as the trend of fiscal policy. In this regard, it states that governments should reverse the support measures associated with the energy crisis and the orientation of fiscal policies should be restrictive already in 2024 and in the following years to gradually reduce the high levels of public debt and structural deficits observed. in some countries. \"In summary, the high level of uncertainty implies that we must remain very attentive and not lower our guard to promptly detect any risk that affects the inflation outlook,\" defends De Cos in order to avoid insufficient tightening, which would prevent the achievement of the inflation target, as excessive, which would unnecessarily harm activity and employment.   \n",

The body led by Christine Lagarde adopted a more restrictive stance since July 2022, which has resulted in six new increases in interest rates for this year, placing them at 4.5%. As a consequence, the Euribor has managed to break the 4% barrier, revaluing the credit portfolio of financial entities operating in Spain. Added to this is that the remuneration of deposits has not taken off. All of this is the cocktail that will allow the banks listed on the Ibex 35 to present a record profit, despite the fact that they have had to face the extraordinary tax on the banking sector and increase 'somewhat' the piggy bank of provisions for a default that has not taken off. According to analyst estimates, collected by Bloomberg, the heavyweights of Spanish banking will announce a profit of almost 26,000 million (25,858.25 million euros), 24% more than a year ago when they earned 20,850 million euros, with increases in results of between 24 and 28%. But what's more, only what the three main entities in the country (Banco Santander, BBVA and Caixabank) will score will be enough to surpass last year's joint figures. Banco Santander will break the 10 billion euro barrier, a goal that the previous president, Emilio Botin, had set before the financial crisis stood in the entity's way. Specifically, analyst estimates place the net profit of the entity led by Hector Grisi at 10,777 million euros, thanks to the boost in interest margin that will exceed 43,000 million euros, which benefits from the rise in rates in Europe and its fall in Brazil. BBVA's results will continue to be driven by the business in Spain and Mexico. The entity chaired by Carlos Torres will benefit from the rise in interest rates in both regions and from the strong commercial activity in the Central American country. The combination of these two variables will make it possible to increase profits and exceed 7.7 billion euros, marking a new record after the one reached last year. The interest margin would reach 24,188.57 million euros, which represents an advance of 26%. The third in contention will be Caixabank. Its national presence and a business focused on the retail sector will allow it to present a profit of 4,864 million euros, and it is close to the 5,226 million euros obtained in 2021 when the merger with Bankia took place. The bank chaired by Jose Ignacio Goirigolzarri is one of the most benefited by the rise in interest rates despite the fact that it has also been the entity that has had to pay the most in the extraordinary tax on the banking sector. The interest margin would break 10,000 million euros. Banco Sabadell finds itself in this same situation. The bank led by Cesar Gonzalez-Bueno will consolidate profits of over 1,000 million euros, a figure it already reached in the third quarter of the year. Thus, with an interest margin growing by double digits, reaching 4,741 million euros. The net profit will reach 1,315.59 million euros. In 2022, the group reported profits of 859 million euros, 53% more. In 2022 it had already shot up its result by 62%. Bankinter, whose customer focus is on a higher financial profile, will also present a benefit not seen to date driven by credit revaluation and despite the fact that it is one of the entities that most rewards its customers' savings. Thus, the profit will be 865 million euros, above analysts' estimates at the beginning of the year. In 2022, the bank recorded a profit of 684 million euros, which means seeing the result also grow by 26%. Unicaja Banco will also reflect in its accounts the positive impact of the increase in interest rates. The interest margin will reach 1,330 million euros, while the profit will be 331.41 million euros, 28% more.   \n",
       "30158  MADRID, 02 (SERVIMEDIA) The Governor of the Bank of Spain, Pablo Hernandez de Cos, claimed this Tuesday that European governments should \"reverse the support measures associated with the energy crisis\" and establish a fiscal policy whose orientation \"should be restrictive now in 2024 and in the following years to gradually reduce the high levels of public debt and structural deficits observed in some countries. This was indicated by the head of the institution in the article 'Inflation and interest rates in the euro area', published in the Yearbook 'Spain 2024. One year ahead', by EY Insights. Hernandez de Cos framed this request in the fight against inflation, stressing that reducing the deficit and debt is \"essential\" to prevent inflationary pressures from increasing, which would make \"an even more restrictive orientation of monetary policy\" necessary. With this objective in mind, I demand to reach an agreement \"soon\" on the reform of the economic governance framework of the European Union. In his analysis, he recognized that the euro area has experienced in the last two years the \"most intense inflationary episode in its history\" and, as a consequence, the response of monetary policy has also been \"very forceful, with a monetary tightening that \"It is unprecedented neither in its magnitude nor in its speed.\" De Cos attributed the slowdown in price increases in recent months to the evolution of the energy component and the lower pressures on supply chains, as well as to the impact of the tightening of monetary policy. Looking to the future, he recalled that the Eurosystem's projections reflect a continuation of the downward trend, which is expected to converge to the 2% target in 2025, although with a slower decline in 2024. Thus, after maintaining interest rates without variation in December, he noted that the European Central Bank (ECB) continues to assess that, if its current level is maintained for long enough, it is \"very likely\" that the 2% inflation target can be achieved \"in the medium term.\" . In this sense, he stressed that the recent evolution of inflation and the aforementioned projections \"support it\" and noted that they have gained \"confidence\" in these forecasts, given that the forecast errors \"have been reduced in recent months.\" Thus, De Cos indicated that \"the question of how long it will be necessary to maintain interest rates at the current level, before beginning to gradually reduce them, will depend on the future evolution of the data, in a context in which the level of uncertainty remains high\", thus closing the stage of interest increases by the ECB that began in the summer of 2022. UNCERTAINTY The governor of the Bank of Spain believes that a \"useful reference\" to know the future lies in the Eurosystem's projections for the month of November. The median of analyst expectations anticipated the first rate reduction for the beginning of the third quarter of 2024 and that at the end of 2024 the deposit facility rate would be around 3.25% and that in the long term it would reach 2%. Since then, however, he noted that market rates have been reduced \"markedly and are clearly below the path incorporated in the projections.\" Other assumptions have also suffered \"significant changes\", such as the prices of energy raw materials, which have been revised significantly downwards. However, geopolitical developments, particularly in the Middle East, continue to pose a downside risk to growth and an upside risk to inflation. Regarding economic growth, he recalled that the projections showed a new downward revision. Growth of 0.6% is expected in 2023, a slight recovery to 0.8% in 2024, and advances of 1.5% in 2025 and 2026, as the effects of monetary policy disappear. In any case, he stressed that the transmission of monetary policy has been \"surprising them with its strength\", which, if extended in the coming years, would translate into lower growth and inflation. SALARIES AND MARGINS On the other hand, I assure that the evolution of unit labor costs will also be \"crucial\" for the behavior of inflation. The projections incorporate a gradual increase in real wages, which would recover the loss of purchasing power observed in 2022 towards the end of 2024. However, I stressed that labor markets remain stressed, which could generate higher wage pressures, although the fall in the Inflation could also moderate wage demands. Regarding company margins, given the weakness of demand and the resolution of bottlenecks, a compression is expected, as has already happened in the third quarter, indicated De Cos, who noted that their future behavior will be \"crucial\" to assess its role as a buffer against wage pressures. \"The high level of uncertainty means that we must remain very vigilant and not lower our guard to promptly detect any risk that affects the inflation outlook. This way we can avoid both insufficient tightening, which would prevent the achievement of our inflation objective, and excessive, which would unnecessarily harm activity and employment,\" concluded the governor.

Credits Whose Interest Rates Are Reflected What You Raise Mortgages in Loos To Exceed 4.2% EVERY Day We Are Looking At The Euribor Confidence That Sleeping Everything Will Be Normalized And Being Able To Go Again A Little More Comfortable, But We Have Come To Pay Almost 1600 EUR Upload and not see the end the OTHER CONSEQUENCE HAS BEEN contributing to a slowdown in economic growth. That we said that 2023 has been the year with the most rate increases than what the debate has given the first drop in the price of money and what comes from here, that interest rate drops are now coming, when how much good is in itself going There has been an increase and the focus is rather on when a rate scale decline is going to begin, inflation seems to be going under control. It is true that it is expected that the spring of next year is when this de-escalation will begin. Ok Iza April, We will begin to See Rate Drops That Are Not Going to Be Elective either. How has the increase been? Of course, in less than a year, how has it been committed? Well, there have been 10 rate hikes and we have reached negative rates at 4 and a half percent, which has been the ceiling. I believe that what is going to happen IT HAPPENED the Discussion Now More Than 3% Whether the Drop is Going to Be Less, No, No, What We Discount Are With the Current Forecasts OR THEREFORE Half a Point Less at the End of the Year Obviously, Yes. Passion Behaves better the decreases could be higher if I can find the we have some surprise 12 Infraction because everything contrary occurred, but e elect or These decreases are going to occur and of how many basic Points not in Fact and this is WHAT IS WHAT YOU WORRIED THAT IT MIGHT BE CONCERNING MANY INDIVIDUALS AND MANY HOUSEHOLDS. It is that what is going to happen with the Euribor No, and the EURIBOR, WELL, I HAVE ALREADY STARTED, NO, TO ANTICIPATE THIS EXPECTATION OF DOWNMENT TOUCHING THE CEILING INNUTION OF INTEREST RATES. I BELIEVE THAT WHO You're looking at this year, you're thinking about it. Today is my mortgage, so raymond torres works one point half point when, how much I think he. Being in the Evolution of Wages That is to say, What is Happening is that the European Central Bank Amente is on the move. IT SEE THAT, BUT IT IS worried about the Evolution of Wages in all the countries where the Labor Markets are under tension at 2 countries such as, for example, germany and. o Who is waiting for it wants to MAKE SURE THAT EFFECTIVELY THE De-escalation also occurs in terms of salary increase and that is why, How good your SISTER is doing VERY between Rafa and Monica a drop of almost one point0.75 Points, But Well, We are in more or less the same order of magnitude and of course downwards, I realize that the market is probably earlier. But in fact it is Antikipando much more because the European Central Bank in any case First of all we will not return to the era of interest rates, practically zero and the second Gualba will proceed in a very very cautious manner that its decrease in the mortgage rate, which is o as the punishment in the bio will be Much Less than the Previous Punishment Exactly It Will Be Located. Possibly in the area of ​​2% nothing to do with the levels we had at the beginning, we did not come from negative types without Therefore we are going to stay in an intermediate situation between the minimums we had before the rise and the maximums we are seeing now.   \n",

Suomen Pankki Governor  Olli Rehn  stated on Thursday that the  EU  must get its act back together to solve the energy crisis. He considers reducing energy consumption the most important tool. The impact of the energy crisis on economic growth is still ahead for the most part, according to Suomen Pankki.\n",

According to  ECB  Executive Board member  Fabio Panetta , similar design features would have to be applied to the use of a digital euro by non-EU residents.  This would prevent the digital euro from replacing other forms of investment and facilitate currency substitution in countries outside the euro area,\" Mr Panetta said  in a speech in 2021.\n",

The discussion was moderated by Banque de France Governor  François Villeroy de Galhau . The  ECB  and the US Federal Reserve stressed the need not to be left behind by the development of the crypto ecosystem. According to Mr de Galhau, the  ECB  is currently in the research phase of its project but has high ambitions to create a decentralised financial infrastructure. Ms Lagarde said its launch is scheduled for 2026-2027, but the technical contours remain vague. \n",

According to the report, almost two-thirds of  European  banks' business sector revenues come from sectors that emit a lot of greenhouse gases. Furthermore, banks still do not sufficiently incorporate climate risk into their stress testing frameworks and internal models. For  ECB  Supervisory Board Chairman Andrea Enria, euro area credit institutions urgently need to step up efforts to measure and manage climate risk, close existing data gaps and adopt best practices already applied in the industry.  ECB  Executive Board Member  Frank Elderson  said that conducting these tests is crucial in making the financial system more resilient to climate risk.\n",

Speaking of the government, Ms Letizia Moratti is expected to become Minister of Health, while Mr Domenico Siniscalco is rumoured to be nominated as Minister of Economics and Finance. Ms Meloni prefers  ECB  Executive Board Member  Fabio Panetta  for the Ministry of Economics and Finance, but Mr Panetta has refused, and President Sergio Mattarella is the only one able to convince him to change his mind.\n",
      "231    In a panel discussion organised by Banque de France on 27 September,  ECB  President  Christine Lagarde  and Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell highlighted that stablecoins have certain positive aspects, but insisted that they need more regulation, as does the rest of the growing world of crypto assets. Ms Lagarde underlined that stablecoins are \"possibly disruptive\", although so far they only represent 10% of the entire crypto ecosystem. In this sense, Mr Powell indicated that the ultimate goal of regulation is to create a level playing field so that the benefits of innovation can be reaped while avoiding problems. \"If we don't engage in experimentation and innovation in terms of digital money from a  central bank , we risk losing the anchor role that we have adopted for many, many decades,\" Ms Lagarde warned. In this respect, she recalled that it would not be desirable to return to the banking system of the 19th and early 20th centuries.\n",

Uncertainty about the persistence of price pressures continues to call for a “robust control” approach to monetary policy, Ms Schnabel said in a speech in Spain. Such a stance reduces the danger that medium- and long-term inflation expectations move further away from the 2% target, she said. “A decline in real wages and a slowdown in aggregate demand may not materially ease current inflationary pressures,” Ms Schnabel warned, adding that further increases in the  ECB 's key policy rates will be needed. However, she noted that for now, “the risks of a wage-price spiral are contained, provided inflation expectations remain anchored.”\n",

In August, euro area inflation, as measured by the harmonised consumer price index, was 9.1%, and last September it was 3.4%. Record price growth and the fact that inflation is now expressed in double digits in Germany mean additional pressure on the  ECB  to take measures to control it.

Inflation in the euro area reached double digits for the first time in September, driven by a massive surge in energy prices. According to Ms Schnabel, the  ECB  cannot rely solely on model-based forecasts in an environment characterised by abrupt changes, so the data currently coming in is now of particular importance. She added that further policy rate increases are necessary. \n",

The normalisation of the monetary stance has been underway since December when the Governing Council announced the start of a reduction in net purchases of securities as part of its  QE   programmes , Mr Visco added. In the first part of 2022, the process accelerated, avoiding the potentially dangerous effects of a too strong decline; purchases were concluded on 1 July, and a few weeks later, the  ECB  started to significantly increase the official interest rates abandoning the levels that have been negative for a long time, Mr Visco explained. It is a radical change in monetary policy, Mr Visco stressed, concluding that the  ECB  has come out of the  QE  phase but is not in a monetary dominance.\n",

      "10    The differences between the United States and the euro area in the relative weight of supply and demand factors and the dynamics of prices net of the most volatile components explain why the monetary policy normalisation takes place at different speeds and at different times, Banca d’Italia Governor  Ignazio Visco  said in a speech organised by the Florence School of Banking and Finance. These differences suggest that assuming that the  ECB  will blindly follow the US Federal Reserve in the coming months could be a serious mistake, Mr Visco added. The forecast errors on the growth of consumer prices made by the  ECB ’s staff and the Eurosystem, but also other institutions, were high and higher than those observed in the past, perhaps in the opposite direction, Mr Visco stressed. Some have argued that these errors may have called into question the  ECB ’s credibility, but in reality, these errors could indicate that the models used for the projections may need less formal and more judgment-based assessments, Mr Visco concluded.\n",

All  central banks  countered the said crisis by lowering official interest rates to zero, or even negative levels by lowering them close to their effective lower bound, Mr Visco added. The  ECB ’s measures have had an exceptional success, Mr Visco stressed, recalling how the  central bank  found a way out of a situation of deflation and debt that could have brought extraordinary risks. Moreover, the  ECB  and  central banks  do not take decisions without an agreement, even though it is not always unanimous, Mr Visco concluded.\n",

The governor claimed that the  ECB  had started its journey last December and emphasised that the institution's neutral policy rate would be between 0.7% and 1.8%. Therefore, the  ECB  could have already reached this rate with its last interest rate increase or is close to reaching it soon.\n",

Mr Visco added that he did not think it is appropriate to tie the  ECB ’s hands with extraordinary or extraordinarily high increases, referring to experiences of different countries by type of economy. The trend and target of these hikes is a complicated issue also because, given the delay in the repercussion of monetary policy moves, the  ECB  faces a risk that, by raising interest rates, it could affect output and not inflation, Mr Visco explained. Thus, the Governing Council decided to have a meeting-by-meeting and data-dependent approach, Mr Visco concluded.\n",

The  ECB  Governing Council faces a dilemma given that the increase in inflation is now accompanied by a sharp deterioration in the economic growth outlook, Mr Visco added, stressing that in this context, excessively rapid and pronounced interest rate hikes would end up increasing the risks of a recession. According to him, if the deterioration in the economic outlook turns out to be worse than expected, excessive anticipation in the normalisation of official interest rates could be disproportionate, undermining public confidence in the  ECB ’s actions and making it more difficult to maintain price stability over the medium term. It is a risk that deserves careful consideration along with letting inflation remain excessively high for too long, Mr Visco concluded.\n",

Mr Visco also cautioned that while it is fair to deploy fiscal means to support households and firms in the current situation, governments must ensure this does not hurt future generations. “For Italy, this would also entail the risk of derailing public debt from its current descending path,” he added.\n",
      "43    In an interview, Société Générale Chairman of the Board of Directors and former  ECB  Executive Board and Governing Council Member Lorenzo Bini Smaghi warns against panicking. In regard to the outcome of the political elections in Italy, Mr Bini Smaghi notes that the election result was expected, and the strong majority of the centre-right coalition should bring some stability to the Italian government. He adds that, as there will be no elections before 2024, it gives the Italian government time to initiate important things at the beginning of the legislature. Mr Bini Smaghi believes that markets will be watching very closely to see whether the new government will continue the course of leaving Italian Prime Minister Mario Draghi's previous government or deviate significantly. In his words, the government should absolutely avoid conflicts, especially with its  European  partners. Asked whether Italy would be able to deal with further rate hikes by the  ECB , Mr Bini Smaghi says that Italy's real problem is weak growth. it is good to have a precautionary instrument such as the TPI. Whether it will be used in the end remains to be seen. \n",

The energy crisis has created new challenges for public finances in the euro area, the Finnish  central bank  said in Helsinki on Thursday. Countries' efforts to find ways to limit the burden on households from high energy bills are understandable. However, indiscriminate spending increases would not help in the fight against inflation, Mr Rehn pointed out. Instead, tailored, temporary measures to help those most in need were the right approach, he noted.\n",

Isabel Díaz Ayuso, President of the Community of Madrid, has already accused Prime Minister Pedro Sánchez of encroaching on his authority.  ECB  Chief Economist Philip Lane suggested that for both macroeconomic and equity reasons, states should support household income and consumption, but also companies that suffer most from inflation. He pointed out that the solution to the question of how to finance such measures could be in higher taxes for people with higher incomes or for industries and companies that were highly profitable in that scenario, despite the energy crisis. This way, Mr Lane supported extraordinary measures such as taxing the greatest fortunes and a tax on banks and electricity.\n",

Mr Centeno's comments suggest that he is not in line with other Governing Council members who advocate a further 75 basis point hike to contain inflation. According to the Governor, the  ECB  must be a \"source of stability\" and, therefore, it must take \"as small steps as possible\", both in the rise in interest rates and in the reduction of its balance sheet.\n",

Currently, energy and food prices account for between 75% and 80% of the increase in prices. The prices of various raw materials, including energy, currently stand below the figures considered by the  ECB ’s base scenario, and that could be the reflection of lower than expected demand, Mr Hernández de Cos explained. Banco de España expects 2023 inflation to come in at 5.5%, and 2024 inflation at 2.3%.\n",

      "2  ECB  Executive Board Member  Isabel Schnabel  said Friday that even an economic slowdown in  Europe  may not be enough to tame inflation, urging more increases in borrowing costs. Uncertainty about the persistence of price pressures continues to call for a “robust control” approach to monetary policy, Ms Schnabel said in a speech in Spain. Such a stance reduces the danger that medium- and long-term inflation expectations move further away from the 2% target, she said. “A decline in real wages and a slowdown in aggregate demand may not materially ease current inflationary pressures,” Ms Schnabel warned, adding that further increases in the  ECB 's key policy rates will be needed. However, she noted that for now, “the risks of a wage-price spiral are contained, provided inflation expectations remain anchored.”                             https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2022-09-30/ecb-s-schnabel-says-weaker-demand-may-not-ease-price-pressure   \n",

In August, euro area inflation, as measured by the harmonised consumer price index, was 9.1%, and last September it was 3.4%. Record price growth and the fact that inflation is now expressed in double digits in Germany mean additional pressure on the  ECB  to take measures to control it.

A Speech Made Highlighting the Difference Between Europe and the United States which requires a different normalization path. A similar vision is also expressed by the EU Commissioner for Economic Affairs Paolo Gentiloni who calls for fighting inflation \"without killing growth\". For the board of the central bank, a decision will also be made more difficult by the different pace of inflation in European countries, hidden within 10% of the EU figure. If Germany is at 10%, LANDA at 17% and Italy at 8.9%, in Spain prices are rising and so also in France, at +6.2%. In his speech, the Governor claims that the ECB has made its path neither accommodative nor restrictive and that Frankfurt is trying to achieve so as not to further fan the flames of inflation: 'It would be in a range between 0.7 and no rate hike. , orClose to Be Soon >>. Visco's is a clear stop to colleagues who are asking for new sharp increases in GNI. Decision will be made \"based on data\".

Uncertainty about the persistence of price pressures continues to call for a “robust control” approach to monetary policy, Schnabel said Friday in a speech in Spain. Such a stance reduces the danger that medium- and long-term inflation expectations move further away from the 2% target, she said.   \n",

      "0                            At a conference in Florence, Banca d'Italia Governor  Ignazio Visco  warned of the risks of triggering recession if the  ECB  blindly follows the US Federal Reserve and proceeds with excessively rapid and pronounced rate rises. Mr Visco, however, defended the  ECB  from the attacks of those who criticised it as slow in recognising the arrival of high inflation in recent months and stressed that he does not see any apparent reason to assume that the upcoming increases will be extraordinarily high. The governor claimed that the  ECB  had started its journey last December and emphasised that the institution's neutral policy rate would be between 0.7% and 1.8%. Therefore, the  ECB  could have already reached this rate with its last interest rate increase or is close to reaching it soon.                                                                   https://www.ilmessaggero.it/economia/news/tassi_bce_visco_fed-6960546.html   \n",

      "2  ECB  Executive Board Member  Isabel Schnabel  said Friday that even an economic slowdown in  Europe  may not be enough to tame inflation, urging more increases in borrowing costs. Uncertainty about the persistence of price pressures continues to call for a “robust control” approach to monetary policy, Ms Schnabel said in a speech in Spain. Such a stance reduces the danger that medium- and long-term inflation expectations move further away from the 2% target, she said. “A decline in real wages and a slowdown in aggregate demand may not materially ease current inflationary pressures,” Ms Schnabel warned, adding that further increases in the  ECB 's key policy rates will be needed. However, she noted that for now, “the risks of a wage-price spiral are contained, provided inflation expectations remain anchored.”                             https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2022-09-30/ecb-s-schnabel-says-weaker-demand-may-not-ease-price-pressure   \n",

In addition, he expressed concern about the sharp deterioration in growth forecasts.         https://www.ilfoglio.it/adnkronos/2022/09/30/news/-conti-pubblici-visco-rientro-debito-ben-indirizzato-ma-resta-necessario--4500608/   \n",

In August, euro area inflation, as measured by the harmonised consumer price index, was 9.1%, and last September it was 3.4%. Record price growth and the fact that inflation is now expressed in double digits in Germany mean additional pressure on the  ECB  to take measures to control it.  ECB  Governing Council members will meet on 27 October and many experts consider that the  central bank  should continue to be aggressive in the future.

      "0  No to an excessive rise in rates. The Governor of the Bank of Italy, Vincenzo Visco, warns against rapid and pronounced risks >>. After the hail of declarations from the hawks, the Frankfurt leadership in recent days was slow in recognizing the arrival of high inflation in recent months. And the dust of the hawks' front is soaked in the ECB Council: There is no <<obvious reason why Tying Our Hands With Hypotheses of Extraordinarily High Increases Such as Those We Read in Some Parts. A Speech Made Highlighting the Difference Between Europe and the United States which requires a different normalization path. A similar vision is also expressed by the EU Commissioner for Economic Affairs Paolo Gentiloni who calls for fighting inflation \"without killing growth\". For the board of the central bank, a decision will also be made more difficult by the different pace of inflation in European countries, hidden within 10% of the EU figure. If Germany is at 10%, LANDA at 17% and Italy at 8.9%, in Spain prices are rising and so also in France, at +6.2%. In his speech, the Governor claims that the ECB has made its path neither accommodative nor restrictive and that Frankfurt is trying to achieve so as not to further fan the flames of inflation: 'It would be in a range between 0.7 and no rate hike. , orClose to Be Soon >>. Visco's is a clear stop to colleagues who are asking for new sharp increases in GNI. Decision will be made \"based on data\". In the last two days alone, the governors of Austria, Finland, Lithuania and Latvia had pushed the hawkish front in favor of a 75 basis point squeeze in October. IT'S NOT ONLY GROWTH THAT IS VANTI'S TROUBLE FOR FINANCIAL STABILITY>>, the realization of which would have heavy repercussions in all the countries of the euro area, leading to a tightening of financial conditions far greater than what was considered appropriate to contain the high inflation. \"And also for this reason Italy must not abdicate its virtuous path on which Mario Draghi's government has set out: debt reduction. The message, without naming it, is to the new government. Help to combat the energy shock and the expensive bills are possible but only to the most affected companies and families, otherwise the Count will be paid by future generations with the Greater Kingdom.   \n",

Mr Visco, however, defended the  ECB  from the attacks of those who criticised it as slow in recognising the arrival of high inflation in recent months and stressed that he does not see any apparent reason to assume that the upcoming increases will be extraordinarily high. The governor claimed that the  ECB  had started its journey last December and emphasised that the institution's neutral policy rate would be between 0.7% and 1.8%. Therefore, the  ECB  could have already reached this rate with its last interest rate increase or is close to reaching it soon.</td>\n",

After the hail of declarations from the hawks, the Frankfurt leadership in recent days was slow in recognizing the arrival of high inflation in recent months. And the dust of the hawks' front is soaked in the ECB Council: There is no &lt;&lt;obvious reason why Tying Our Hands With Hypotheses of Extraordinarily High Increases Such as Those We Read in Some Parts. A Speech Made Highlighting the Difference Between Europe and the United States which requires a different normalization path. A similar vision is also expressed by the EU Commissioner for Economic Affairs Paolo Gentiloni who calls for fighting inflation \"without killing growth\". For the board of the central bank, a decision will also be made more difficult by the different pace of inflation in European countries, hidden within 10% of the EU figure. If Germany is at 10%, LANDA at 17% and Italy at 8.9%, in Spain prices are rising and so also in France, at +6.2%. In his speech, the Governor claims that the ECB has made its path neither accommodative nor restrictive and that Frankfurt is trying to achieve so as not to further fan the flames of inflation: 'It would be in a range between 0.7 and no rate hike. , orClose to Be Soon &gt;&gt;. Visco's is a clear stop to colleagues who are asking for new sharp increases in GNI. Decision will be made \"based on data\". In the last two days alone, the governors of Austria, Finland, Lithuania and Latvia had pushed the hawkish front in favor of a 75 basis point squeeze in October. IT'S NOT ONLY GROWTH THAT IS VANTI'S TROUBLE FOR FINANCIAL STABILITY&gt;&gt;, the realization of which would have heavy repercussions in all the countries of the euro area, leading to a tightening of financial conditions far greater than what was considered appropriate to contain the high inflation. \"And also for this reason Italy must not abdicate its virtuous path on which Mario Draghi's government has set out: debt reduction. The message, without naming it, is to the new government. Help to combat the energy shock and the expensive bills are possible but only to the most affected companies and families, otherwise the Count will be paid by future generations with the Greater Kingdom.</td>\n",

       "0                            At a conference in Florence, Banca d'Italia Governor  Ignazio Visco  warned of the risks of triggering recession if the  ECB  blindly follows the US Federal Reserve and proceeds with excessively rapid and pronounced rate rises. Mr Visco, however, defended the  ECB  from the attacks of those who criticised it as slow in recognising the arrival of high inflation in recent months and stressed that he does not see any apparent reason to assume that the upcoming increases will be extraordinarily high. The governor claimed that the  ECB  had started its journey last December and emphasised that the institution's neutral policy rate would be between 0.7% and 1.8%. Therefore, the  ECB  could have already reached this rate with its last interest rate increase or is close to reaching it soon.                                                                   https://www.ilmessaggero.it/economia/news/tassi_bce_visco_fed-6960546.html   \n",

       "2  ECB  Executive Board Member  Isabel Schnabel  said Friday that even an economic slowdown in  Europe  may not be enough to tame inflation, urging more increases in borrowing costs. Uncertainty about the persistence of price pressures continues to call for a “robust control” approach to monetary policy, Ms Schnabel said in a speech in Spain. Such a stance reduces the danger that medium- and long-term inflation expectations move further away from the 2% target, she said. “A decline in real wages and a slowdown in aggregate demand may not materially ease current inflationary pressures,” Ms Schnabel warned, adding that further increases in the  ECB 's key policy rates will be needed. However, she noted that for now, “the risks of a wage-price spiral are contained, provided inflation expectations remain anchored.”                             https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2022-09-30/ecb-s-schnabel-says-weaker-demand-may-not-ease-price-pressure   \n",

In August, euro area inflation, as measured by the harmonised consumer price index, was 9.1%, and last September it was 3.4%. Record price growth and the fact that inflation is now expressed in double digits in Germany mean additional pressure on the  ECB  to take measures to control it.

       "0  No to an excessive rise in rates. The Governor of the Bank of Italy, Vincenzo Visco, warns against rapid and pronounced risks >>. After the hail of declarations from the hawks, the Frankfurt leadership in recent days was slow in recognizing the arrival of high inflation in recent months. And the dust of the hawks' front is soaked in the ECB Council: There is no <<obvious reason why Tying Our Hands With Hypotheses of Extraordinarily High Increases Such as Those We Read in Some Parts. A Speech Made Highlighting the Difference Between Europe and the United States which requires a different normalization path. A similar vision is also expressed by the EU Commissioner for Economic Affairs Paolo Gentiloni who calls for fighting inflation \"without killing growth\". For the board of the central bank, a decision will also be made more difficult by the different pace of inflation in European countries, hidden within 10% of the EU figure. If Germany is at 10%, LANDA at 17% and Italy at 8.9%, in Spain prices are rising and so also in France, at +6.2%. In his speech, the Governor claims that the ECB has made its path neither accommodative nor restrictive and that Frankfurt is trying to achieve so as not to further fan the flames of inflation: 'It would be in a range between 0.7 and no rate hike. , orClose to Be Soon >>. Visco's is a clear stop to colleagues who are asking for new sharp increases in GNI. Decision will be made \"based on data\". In the last two days alone, the governors of Austria, Finland, Lithuania and Latvia had pushed the hawkish front in favor of a 75 basis point squeeze in October. IT'S NOT ONLY GROWTH THAT IS VANTI'S TROUBLE FOR FINANCIAL STABILITY>>, the realization of which would have heavy repercussions in all the countries of the euro area, leading to a tightening of financial conditions far greater than what was considered appropriate to contain the high inflation. \"And also for this reason Italy must not abdicate its virtuous path on which Mario Draghi's government has set out: debt reduction. The message, without naming it, is to the new government. Help to combat the energy shock and the expensive bills are possible but only to the most affected companies and families, otherwise the Count will be paid by future generations with the Greater Kingdom.   \n",

Uncertainty about the persistence of price pressures continues to call for a “robust control” approach to monetary policy, Schnabel said Friday in a speech in Spain. Such a stance reduces the danger that medium- and long-term inflation expectations move further away from the 2% target, she said.   \n",
