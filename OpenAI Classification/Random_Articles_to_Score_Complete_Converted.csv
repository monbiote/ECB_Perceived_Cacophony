1,"Starting in October, the  ECB  wants to use a new climate score to restructure its portfolio of corporate bonds in such a way that companies with a better climate balance are preferred to those with a worse one. The  central bank  published the relevant details on Monday. According to earlier  ECB  information, the volume involved will be around EUR 30 billion per year over the next few years. Since taking office in November 2019,  ECB  President  Christine Lagarde  has been pushing for the  ECB  to play a more active role in the fight against climate change. However, this is controversial, partly also in the  ECB  Governing Council. The climate score now published is made up of three sub-components: The backward-looking issuance sub-score is based on issuers' past issuances. This examines how the companies perform compared to their peers in a given sector as well as compared to all eligible bond issuers. The forward-looking sub-score is based on the targets the issuers have set for reducing their greenhouse gas emissions. In addition, the climate risk disclosure sub-score assesses issuers' reporting of their greenhouse gas emissions. Greenpeace criticised on Monday that the  ECB  did not take a more rigorous approach and exclude climate sinners and sell their securities. ""Instead, the  ECB  has obviously only opted for cosmetic changes. In this way, it joins the illustrious round of green label swindlers who shun credible climate protection.""",0,0,0,0.0

The idea of taxing the wealthiest is already gaining ground within the euro area. Governments should support the income and consumption of those households and firms that are suffering the most, Mr Lane has noted in an interview with Der Standard. ""The big question is whether part of this support ought to be financed by tax increases for those that are better off"", he said, explaining that this could take the form of higher taxes on higher earners or on industries and firms that are highly profitable in spite of the energy shock. The  ECB  is in favour of targeted state aid in order to protect households from the impact of inflation, as  ECB  President  Christine Lagarde  told the  European  Parliament on Monday.",1,0,1,0.6666666666666666

They suggested they would consider a pause at some point, but neither of the  central banks  is quite there. But the bond market heard what it wanted: that there will be a pause, Ms Aquino remarks. According to journalist Alexander Weber, there is little to indicate that the  ECB  is close to ending its rate hike cycle from its statements on 2 February. The  ECB  Governing Council intends to raise rates by 50 basis points in March and then reevaluate the situation. In the press conference following the meeting,  ECB  President  Christine Lagarde  tried to dispel the notion that the  ECB  is close to being done. Ms Lagarde said there was more ground to cover. The concerns about core inflation and wage growth accelerating point to further tightening measures, Mr Weber believes. He adds that if the tightening message does not filter through to the market, hawkish  ECB  Governing Council members could reassure market participants that the  ECB  will continue to hike its rates. Ms Aquino suggests that the markets could be questioning whether the  ECB  can stay the course when the Fed has already hinted at a soon end of the rate hike cycle.",1,1,1,1.0

However, the  ECB  provided few details about the path of rate hikes. Ms Lagarde said the  central bank  had made ''substantial'' progress in withdrawing easy money from the euro area, and the number and magnitude of upcoming moves would be determined by data at each policy meeting.

She added that rates were not yet “sufficiently restrictive” to return inflation to the 2% target. Pictet Wealth Management Head of Macroeconomic Research Frederik Ducrozet said he expected the  ECB  to raise rates 25 basis points in June and possibly in July depending on developments in the US banking system.

ECB  President  Christine Lagarde  and US Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell will probably spend their respective August holidays in front of their monitors, waiting for the flurry of macroeconomic data that will accompany them to the two crucial dates of 14 and 20 September when first the  ECB  and then the Fed will present their monetary policy decisions. In its latest Economic Bulletin published on 10 August, the  ECB  reiterated that the Governing Council will continue to follow a data-driven approach in determining the appropriate level and duration of restrictive orientation. The  central bank  showed concern about core inflation, calculated net of energy and food, the result of domestic price pressures also due to rising wages and profit margins.",0,1,0,0.3333333333333333
89,"In an interview for Corriere Della Sera, Italy's Economy Undersecretary Federico Freni states that Banca d'Italia Governor  Ignazio Visco  is right to criticise the  ECB  for its prolonged rate hikes. Monetary policy should move with great caution. He added that the geopolitical scenario remains uncertain and that rate hikes should be dosed well to avoid unwanted effects. Inflation, however, is still high. While it is true that the  ECB  and US Federal Reserve's monetary policies often move in tandem, in this case the inflation fundamentals are different and require different choices on interest rates. Mr Freni does not expect strong inflationary consequences on Italy's debt and growth. He predicts more targeted and selective support for energy costs.",-1,-1,-1,-1.0
90,"ECB  Chief Economist Philip Lane said on Tuesday that he anticipates a challenging path to mitigate inflation in energy and food prices but does not expect a significant price surge this autumn. Inflation growth in the euro area is slowing down, though it is too early to declare victory, as more data is required, he said. The possibility of another interest rate hike on 14 September is being discussed, which may mark the end of this tightening cycle due to the deteriorating economic outlook in the euro area. The  ECB  aims to curb inflation in the euro area and bring it to its 2% target through interest rate increases. Mr Lane welcomed the recent estimate showing a decline in the pace of inflation growth in August to 5.3% from July's 5.5% but emphasised the need for this downward trend to continue.",1,1,1,1.0
91,"Milton Friedman, the Nobel Prize-winning economist, had expressed concerns about the challenges of merging multiple sovereign currencies into one, which he believed would eventually lead to the failure of the euro. However, Otmar Issing, a German academic and a key figure in establishing the  ECB , has received a letter from Friedman acknowledging that Issing's efforts might delay the collapse of the euro. Despite surviving longer than Friedman anticipated, the euro has faced persistent challenges, including the sovereign debt crisis and recent periods of turmoil. However,  ECB  President  Christine Lagarde  has acknowledged the unforeseen crises the euro has encountered. Otmar Issing emphasises the magnitude of the task of building a  central bank  from scratch, noting the criticism and doubts from the international press. He also criticises  central banks  for not adequately explaining the limits of their powers during the period of low inflation following the global financial crisis. Issing argues that  central banks  must continue tightening monetary policy until inflation is under control, cautioning against the risks of premature policy changes.",0,0,1,0.3333333333333333
92,"During his opening speech at the 14th MAECI-Banca d'Italia conference, Banca d'Italia Governor  Ignazio Visco  acknowledged that while monetary policy has successfully stabilised expectations thus far, the uncertain geopolitical situation has made predicting future macroeconomic trends increasingly challenging. Monetary policy will therefore have to continue to move prudently, guided by data that will gradually become available, to bring inflation back to the 2% target in the medium term without jeopardising financial stability and minimising the adverse effects on the still fragile recovery. The Governor recalled that the  ECB 's monetary policy stance had significantly changed since the end of 2021 due to the acceleration of price growth. The first step was to announce the reduction of net asset purchases. Throughout 2022, this process has accelerated while avoiding sudden changes in monetary conditions, particularly given the uncertainty caused by the invasion of Ukraine, Mr Visco explained.Â ",0,1,0,0.3333333333333333

94,"Speaking at an event in Portugal on Tuesday,  ECB  president  Christine Lagarde  said that Inflation in the euro area is too high and is set to remain so for too long. But the nature of the inflation challenge in the euro area is changing. She stressed that inflation is still too high and it is still too early to declare victory over consumer price rises. “We have made significant progress but — faced with a more persistent inflation process — we cannot waver, and we cannot declare victory yet,” Ms Lagarde added. She also said the  central bank  should make it clear that interest rates will remain ""at these levels for as long as it takes"". According to her, it is unlikely that in the near future the  central bank  will be able to state with full confidence that the peak rates have been reached. This is why  ECB  policy should be decided meeting by meeting and must remain data-dependent, Ms Lagarde underlined. Ms Lagarde stressed that at the  ECB  Governing Council, ""we were clear that two elements of our policy would be key: we would have to bring interest rates to fairly restrictive' levels and keep them there for as long as necessary."" Setting the right ""level"" would be critical to  central bank  monetary policy as it continues the tightening cycle, she argued.",1,1,1,1.0
95,"The long-term lending rules for banks might be up changes, as some  ECB  officials are of the mind that retroactive adjustments could be legally feasible. The basis for existing contracts, which were drawn up in a climate of sluggish inflation and negative borrowing costs, has been eroded by inflation surpassing 10% and the rapid increase in interest rates.  ECB  President  Christine Lagarde  commented in September that a review of  TLTRO  will be “conducted in due course”, leaving the Governing Council’s next meeting on 26-27 October as the next chance to debate the question.",0,0,0,0.0
96,"In an interview, Isabel Camarinha, CGTP Secretary-General, criticised the notion that increased salaries contribute to high inflation rates, labelling it as a ""hoax"". Ms Camarinha argued that speculation and profit margin increases among large economic groups are the real culprits behind rising inflation. She expressed frustration with the  ECB , the  European  Union, and the Portuguese government for perpetuating this narrative while workers face difficulties and major economic groups continue to generate massive profits. Ms Camarinha called for a national day of struggle, demanding higher salaries and highlighting the country's counterproductive development path. She urged workers to unite and demand solutions to their problems for improved lives and national development. On the other hand,  ECB  President  Christine Lagarde  claimed that wage increases are triggering a sustained process of upward convergence of wages, with workers attempting to recoup previous losses suffered from the inflationary shock.",1,-1,-1,-0.3333333333333333

99,"The prices of German Bunds rose on 3 March. The market attributed the price gains to a countermovement to the losses on 2 March. In the euro area, the high inflationary pressure at the corporate level weakened significantly at the beginning of the year. While overall inflation fell slightly in February, core inflation rose to a record high. Economists interpret this as an indication that price pressures from the energy and commodities sectors could spread to other sectors, such as services. The  ECB  is, therefore, likely to raise its interest rates again by 0.50 percentage points in mid-March. Several  central bankers  argued that further rate hikes were necessary to curb high inflation.
