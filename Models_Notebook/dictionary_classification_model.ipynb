      "Article: At a conference in Florence, Banca d'Italia Governor  Ignazio Visco  warned of the risks of triggering recession if the  ECB  blindly follows the US Federal Reserve and proceeds with excessively rapid and pronounced rate rises. Mr Visco, however, defended the  ECB  from the attacks of those who criticised it as slow in recognising the arrival of high inflation in recent months and stressed that he does not see any apparent reason to assume that the upcoming increases will be extraordinarily high. The governor claimed that the  ECB  had started its journey last December and emphasised that the institution's neutral policy rate would be between 0.7% and 1.8%. Therefore, the  ECB  could have already reached this rate with its last interest rate increase or is close to reaching it soon.\n",

      "Article: ECB  Executive Board Member  Isabel Schnabel  said Friday that even an economic slowdown in  Europe  may not be enough to tame inflation, urging more increases in borrowing costs. Uncertainty about the persistence of price pressures continues to call for a “robust control” approach to monetary policy, Ms Schnabel said in a speech in Spain. Such a stance reduces the danger that medium- and long-term inflation expectations move further away from the 2% target, she said. “A decline in real wages and a slowdown in aggregate demand may not materially ease current inflationary pressures,” Ms Schnabel warned, adding that further increases in the  ECB 's key policy rates will be needed. However, she noted that for now, “the risks of a wage-price spiral are contained, provided inflation expectations remain anchored.”\n",

The unprecedentedly high rate of inflation backs the argument that the  ECB  has to raise interest rates further to cool off demand and bring the increase in prices down. Javier Molina, senior market analyst at eToro, comments that energy is the main inflation driver. Nevertheless, the  ECB  has to do all it can to bring inflation down. And this means that at its next meeting, the  central bank  will raise rates by 75 basis points. But the market starts to fear that the hike could be even bigger, Mr Molina warns. ING Economist Bert Colijn thinks that the  ECB  will be raising rates drastically at the next several meeting, beginning with a 75-basis-point hike in October. At her latest hearing before the  European  Parliament,  ECB  President  Christine Lagarde  said the  central bank  expects “to raise interest rates further over the next several meetings to dampen demand and guard against the risk of a persistent upward shift in inflation expectations.”\n",

It was also the focus of the speech on Thursday by Banco de España Governor  Pablo Hernández de Cos  at the congress of the Spanish Confederation of Directors and Executives at the Bilbao Exhibition Centre. In the Governor's opinion, the  ECB  is currently facing a dilemma between stopping inflation and protecting economic activity. An excessively \"forceful\" reaction could worsen economic growth and worsen the employment situation. At the same time, taking \"too weak\" measures may not be enough to stop the inflationary spiral. That is why Mr Hernández de Cos believes that although interest rates will continue to rise, they will do so up to a maximum of 2.25% or 2.5%.\n",

However, the  ECB  is responsible for its communication, which was still negligently appeasing even when consumers had long felt the pressure on prices and economists had long warned of a sustained return of inflation. The  ECB 's strategy of raising interest rates sharply but at the same time not stopping its purchases of government bonds out of consideration for over-indebted states like Italy is damaging the credibility of the  central bank . It undermines confidence in the  ECB 's determination to fight inflation, the author insists. In any case, President  Christine Lagarde  has severely damaged this confidence.

The authors note that  ECB  President  Christine Lagarde  sounded very determined on Monday that the  central bank  will not use its latest crisis instrument to bail out countries whose governments make \"policy mistakes\". In their view, there is enormous mistrust in  Europe 's power centres towards Italy and it is said that something will have to be done before panic spreads. The authors claim that tight criteria still gives hope, but there are concerns that the temptation to challenge the  ECB  with new spending  programmes  could grow in Italy. However, due to its dependence on  EU  funds, Italy is expected to continue former Prime Minister Mario Draghi's fiscal policy as promised. The authors conclude that the EC is also counting on the power distribution within the new government to be in its favour. \n",

They said that investors were reacting to political uncertainty and that the  ECB  would need to see what the new Italian government's policies are before intervening. Although Italian yields are at their highest in 10 years, the TPI requires that a country is hit by a market rout through no fault of its own.

The negative impact of the energy crisis on economic growth is still lying, the Finnish  central bank  assesses in a recent forecast.

Suomen Pankki Governor  Olli Rehn  said the reason previous forecasts had failed to predict the high inflation was the failure to recognise how much Russia's energy war with  Europe  would raise the price of gas. Although monetary policy has only limited scope to influence energy prices, it must respond to the increased general rate of price rises, according to the  central bank .
