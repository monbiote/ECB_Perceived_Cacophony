The governor claimed that the  ECB  had started its journey last December and emphasised that the institution's neutral policy rate would be between 0.7% and 1.8%.

After the hail of declarations from the hawks, the Frankfurt leadership in recent days was slow in recognizing the arrival of high inflation in recent months. And the dust of the hawks' front is soaked in the ECB Council: There is no &lt;&lt;obvious reason why Tying Our Hands With Hypotheses of Extraordinarily High Increases Such as Those We Read in Some Parts. A Speech Made Highlighting the Difference Between Europe and the United States which requires a different normalization path. A similar vision is also expressed by the EU Commissioner for Economic Affairs Paolo Gentiloni who calls for fighting inflation \"without killing growth\". For the board of the central bank, a decision will also be made more difficult by the different pace of inflation in European countries, hidden within 10% of the EU figure. If Germany is at 10%, LANDA at 17% and Italy at 8.9%, in Spain prices are rising and so also in France, at +6.2%. In his speech, the Governor claims that the ECB has made its path neither accommodative nor restrictive and that Frankfurt is trying to achieve so as not to further fan the flames of inflation: 'It would be in a range between 0.7 and no rate hike. , orClose to Be Soon &gt;&gt;. Visco's is a clear stop to colleagues who are asking for new sharp increases in GNI. Decision will be made \"based on data\". In the last two days alone, the governors of Austria, Finland, Lithuania and Latvia had pushed the hawkish front in favor of a 75 basis point squeeze in October. IT'S NOT ONLY GROWTH THAT IS VANTI'S TROUBLE FOR FINANCIAL STABILITY&gt;&gt;, the realization of which would have heavy repercussions in all the countries of the euro area, leading to a tightening of financial conditions far greater than what was considered appropriate to contain the high inflation. \"And also for this reason Italy must not abdicate its virtuous path on which Mario Draghi's government has set out: debt reduction. The message, without naming it, is to the new government. Help to combat the energy shock and the expensive bills are possible but only to the most affected companies and families, otherwise the Count will be paid by future generations with the Greater Kingdom.</td>\n",

Many are calling for another rate hike of 75 basis points. However, according to Visco, the ECB must not rely too much on other central banks and reduce its room for maneuver. \"The assumption that the ECB will blindly follow the US Fed in the coming months can be a very wrong estimate.\" The ECB has increased its key rate this year by a total of 1.25 percentage points. The US central bank, the Fed, has already raised rates by a total of 3 percentage points The reason for the tightening of monetary policies is high inflation.</td>\n",

On Friday, the governor of the Italian central bank warned against excessive key interest rate increases Through the European Central Bank (ECB). “The rising inflation is now accompanied by a sudden deterioration in the economic growth prospects,” said Visco, who also helps determine monetary policy in the ECB Council, on Friday in Florence. “Against this background, rapid and significant interest rate increases increase the risk of a recession. \" The ECB has raised its key interest rate by a total of 1.25 percentage points this year. The Fed, on the other hand, has already raised its interest rates by 3.00 percentage points. At their most recent meetings, both central banks increased their key interest rates by 0.75 percentage points each. Recently, numerous ECB representatives had spoken out in favor of further significant interest rate increases. A further increase of 0.75 percentage points was often specifically advocated. According to Visco, the ECB must not orient itself too much towards other central banks and limit certain options for action. \"The assumption that \"If the ECB blindly follows the Fed in the coming months, it could be a serious miscalculation.\" If interest rates rise less sharply than feared, this will be positive for the stock market. Background: When key and bond interest rates rise, fixed-interest securities become more attractive, while stocks lose this due to the higher risk. In addition, companies can raise money more easily when interest rates are lower However, investors should note one thing: Visco is considered a monetary policy dove by experts. He is therefore already cautious about tightening monetary policy. With material from DPA-AFX.</td>\n",

Mr Visco, however, defended the  ECB  from the attacks of those who criticised it as slow in recognising the arrival of high inflation in recent months and stressed that he does not see any apparent reason to assume that the upcoming increases will be extraordinarily high. The governor claimed that the  ECB  had started its journey last December and emphasised that the institution's neutral policy rate would be between 0.7% and 1.8%. Therefore, the  ECB  could have already reached this rate with its last interest rate increase or is close to reaching it soon.   \n",

Uncertainty about the persistence of price pressures continues to call for a “robust control” approach to monetary policy, Ms Schnabel said in a speech in Spain. Such a stance reduces the danger that medium- and long-term inflation expectations move further away from the 2% target, she said. “A decline in real wages and a slowdown in aggregate demand may not materially ease current inflationary pressures,” Ms Schnabel warned, adding that further increases in the  ECB 's key policy rates will be needed. However, she noted that for now, “the risks of a wage-price spiral are contained, provided inflation expectations remain anchored.”   \n",

In August, euro area inflation, as measured by the harmonised consumer price index, was 9.1%, and last September it was 3.4%. Record price growth and the fact that inflation is now expressed in double digits in Germany mean additional pressure on the  ECB  to take measures to control it.  ECB  Governing Council members will meet on 27 October and many experts consider that the  central bank  should continue to be aggressive in the future.  ECB  President  Christine Lagarde  has explicitly confirmed that interest rate hikes are far from over.   \n",

Mr Visco added that he did not think it is appropriate to tie the  ECB ’s hands with extraordinary or extraordinarily high increases, referring to experiences of different countries by type of economy. The trend and target of these hikes is a complicated issue also because, given the delay in the repercussion of monetary policy moves, the  ECB  faces a risk that, by raising interest rates, it could affect output and not inflation, Mr Visco explained. Thus, the Governing Council decided to have a meeting-by-meeting and data-dependent approach, Mr Visco concluded.   \n",

Inflation in the euro area reached double digits for the first time in September, driven by a massive surge in energy prices. According to Ms Schnabel, the  ECB  cannot rely solely on model-based forecasts in an environment characterised by abrupt changes, so the data currently coming in is now of particular importance. She added that further policy rate increases are necessary.    \n",

       "18  The monetary policy normalisation will have to continue with the aim of gradually reabsorbing the large accommodation created since 2014 when inflation was very low, Banca d’Italia Governor  Ignazio Visco  said in a speech organised by the Florence School of Banking and Finance. The  ECB  Governing Council faces a dilemma given that the increase in inflation is now accompanied by a sharp deterioration in the economic growth outlook, Mr Visco added, stressing that in this context, excessively rapid and pronounced interest rate hikes would end up increasing the risks of a recession. According to him, if the deterioration in the economic outlook turns out to be worse than expected, excessive anticipation in the normalisation of official interest rates could be disproportionate, undermining public confidence in the  ECB ’s actions and making it more difficult to maintain price stability over the medium term. It is a risk that deserves careful consideration along with letting inflation remain excessively high for too long, Mr Visco concluded.   \n",

And the dust of the hawks' front is soaked in the ECB Council: There is no <<obvious reason why Tying Our Hands With Hypotheses of Extraordinarily High Increases Such as Those We Read in Some Parts. A Speech Made Highlighting the Difference Between Europe and the United States which requires a different normalization path. A similar vision is also expressed by the EU Commissioner for Economic Affairs Paolo Gentiloni who calls for fighting inflation \"without killing growth\". For the board of the central bank, a decision will also be made more difficult by the different pace of inflation in European countries, hidden within 10% of the EU figure. If Germany is at 10%, LANDA at 17% and Italy at 8.9%, in Spain prices are rising and so also in France, at +6.2%. In his speech, the Governor claims that the ECB has made its path neither accommodative nor restrictive and that Frankfurt is trying to achieve so as not to further fan the flames of inflation: 'It would be in a range between 0.7 and no rate hike. , orClose to Be Soon >>. Visco's is a clear stop to colleagues who are asking for new sharp increases in GNI. Decision will be made \"based on data\". In the last two days alone, the governors of Austria, Finland, Lithuania and Latvia had pushed the hawkish front in favor of a 75 basis point squeeze in October.

The message, without naming it, is to the new government.

TASR informs about it on the basis of the report of the DPA agency. \"Rising inflation now goes hand in hand with a sudden worsening of growth prospects,\" said Visco, who is a member of the Board of Governors of the European Central Bank. \"In this situation, too fast and too aggressive an increase in rates increases the risk of recession.\" The majority of ECB officials signaled that they continue to support the rapid tightening of monetary policy. Many are calling for another rate hike of 75 basis points. However, according to Visco, the ECB must not rely too much on other central banks and reduce its room for maneuver. \"The assumption that the ECB will blindly follow the US Fed in the coming months can be a very wrong estimate.\" The ECB has increased its key rate this year by a total of 1.25 percentage points. The US central bank, the Fed, has already raised rates by a total of 3 percentage points The reason for the tightening of monetary policies is high inflation.   \n",

However, the statements of ECB Council member Ignazio Visco could now provide some calm on the stock markets. On Friday, the governor of the Italian central bank warned against excessive key interest rate increases Through the European Central Bank (ECB). “The rising inflation is now accompanied by a sudden deterioration in the economic growth prospects,” said Visco, who also helps determine monetary policy in the ECB Council, on Friday in Florence. “Against this background, rapid and significant interest rate increases increase the risk of a recession. \" The ECB has raised its key interest rate by a total of 1.25 percentage points this year. The Fed, on the other hand, has already raised its interest rates by 3.00 percentage points. At their most recent meetings, both central banks increased their key interest rates by 0.75 percentage points each. Recently, numerous ECB representatives had spoken out in favor of further significant interest rate increases. A further increase of 0.75 percentage points was often specifically advocated. According to Visco, the ECB must not orient itself too much towards other central banks and limit certain options for action. \"The assumption that \"If the ECB blindly follows the Fed in the coming months, it could be a serious miscalculation.\" If interest rates rise less sharply than feared, this will be positive for the stock market. Background: When key and bond interest rates rise, fixed-interest securities become more attractive, while stocks lose this due to the higher risk. In addition, companies can raise money more easily when interest rates are lower However, investors should note one thing: Visco is considered a monetary policy dove by experts. He is therefore already cautious about tightening monetary policy. With material from DPA-AFX.   \n",

Not\\\\n one can in fact ignore the redistributive and allocative consequences of\\\\n what happens on the energy front\".\\\\n \\\\n   \"If, however, it were decided to make redistribution weigh above all\\\\n on future generations essentially with the issuance of debt\\\\n public, there would be a risk of burdening the latter with unfair burdens and\\\\n further fuel current and expected inflation. For Italy, that is\\\\n it would also carry the risk of derailing public debt from\\\\n return journey, in relation to the product, which began last year\\\\n year, a necessary path to preserve the possibility of returning to\\\\n strong and lasting economic growth\", he concluded.\\\\n reverse\\\\n \\\\n (end)\\\\n \\\\n MF-DJ NEWS   \n",

This was underlined by the Governor of the Florence School of Banking and Finance, observing that \"in this context, excessively rapid and pronounced rate rises would end up increasing the risks of a recession\". Worse Than Expected - Observe - An excessive advance in the normalization of rates in our shares and would paradoxically make it more difficult to maintain price stability in the medium term. It is a risk that deserves to be carefully considered together with that of letting inflation remains excessively high for too long.\"   \n",

The governor claimed that the  ECB  had started its journey last December and emphasised that the institution's neutral policy rate would be between 0.7% and 1.8%.

After the hail of declarations from the hawks, the Frankfurt leadership in recent days was slow in recognizing the arrival of high inflation in recent months. And the dust of the hawks' front is soaked in the ECB Council: There is no &lt;&lt;obvious reason why Tying Our Hands With Hypotheses of Extraordinarily High Increases Such as Those We Read in Some Parts. A Speech Made Highlighting the Difference Between Europe and the United States which requires a different normalization path. A similar vision is also expressed by the EU Commissioner for Economic Affairs Paolo Gentiloni who calls for fighting inflation \"without killing growth\". For the board of the central bank, a decision will also be made more difficult by the different pace of inflation in European countries, hidden within 10% of the EU figure. If Germany is at 10%, LANDA at 17% and Italy at 8.9%, in Spain prices are rising and so also in France, at +6.2%. In his speech, the Governor claims that the ECB has made its path neither accommodative nor restrictive and that Frankfurt is trying to achieve so as not to further fan the flames of inflation: 'It would be in a range between 0.7 and no rate hike. , orClose to Be Soon &gt;&gt;. Visco's is a clear stop to colleagues who are asking for new sharp increases in GNI. Decision will be made \"based on data\". In the last two days alone, the governors of Austria, Finland, Lithuania and Latvia had pushed the hawkish front in favor of a 75 basis point squeeze in October. IT'S NOT ONLY GROWTH THAT IS VANTI'S TROUBLE FOR FINANCIAL STABILITY&gt;&gt;, the realization of which would have heavy repercussions in all the countries of the euro area, leading to a tightening of financial conditions far greater than what was considered appropriate to contain the high inflation. \"And also for this reason Italy must not abdicate its virtuous path on which Mario Draghi's government has set out: debt reduction. The message, without naming it, is to the new government. Help to combat the energy shock and the expensive bills are possible but only to the most affected companies and families, otherwise the Count will be paid by future generations with the Greater Kingdom.</td>\n",

Many are calling for another rate hike of 75 basis points. However, according to Visco, the ECB must not rely too much on other central banks and reduce its room for maneuver. \"The assumption that the ECB will blindly follow the US Fed in the coming months can be a very wrong estimate.\" The ECB has increased its key rate this year by a total of 1.25 percentage points. The US central bank, the Fed, has already raised rates by a total of 3 percentage points The reason for the tightening of monetary policies is high inflation.</td>\n",

       "      <td>The fear of an approaching recession and further rising interest rates has recently put the stock markets under significant pressure. However, the statements of ECB Council member Ignazio Visco could now provide some calm on the stock markets. On Friday, the governor of the Italian central bank warned against excessive key interest rate increases Through the European Central Bank (ECB). “The rising inflation is now accompanied by a sudden deterioration in the economic growth prospects,” said Visco, who also helps determine monetary policy in the ECB Council, on Friday in Florence. “Against this background, rapid and significant interest rate increases increase the risk of a recession. \" The ECB has raised its key interest rate by a total of 1.25 percentage points this year. The Fed, on the other hand, has already raised its interest rates by 3.00 percentage points. At their most recent meetings, both central banks increased their key interest rates by 0.75 percentage points each. Recently, numerous ECB representatives had spoken out in favor of further significant interest rate increases. A further increase of 0.75 percentage points was often specifically advocated. According to Visco, the ECB must not orient itself too much towards other central banks and limit certain options for action. \"The assumption that \"If the ECB blindly follows the Fed in the coming months, it could be a serious miscalculation.\" If interest rates rise less sharply than feared, this will be positive for the stock market. Background: When key and bond interest rates rise, fixed-interest securities become more attractive, while stocks lose this due to the higher risk. In addition, companies can raise money more easily when interest rates are lower However, investors should note one thing: Visco is considered a monetary policy dove by experts. He is therefore already cautious about tightening monetary policy. With material from DPA-AFX.</td>\n",

Mr Visco, however, defended the  ECB  from the attacks of those who criticised it as slow in recognising the arrival of high inflation in recent months and stressed that he does not see any apparent reason to assume that the upcoming increases will be extraordinarily high. The governor claimed that the  ECB  had started its journey last December and emphasised that the institution's neutral policy rate would be between 0.7% and 1.8%. Therefore, the  ECB  could have already reached this rate with its last interest rate increase or is close to reaching it soon.   \n",

Uncertainty about the persistence of price pressures continues to call for a “robust control” approach to monetary policy, Ms Schnabel said in a speech in Spain. Such a stance reduces the danger that medium- and long-term inflation expectations move further away from the 2% target, she said. “A decline in real wages and a slowdown in aggregate demand may not materially ease current inflationary pressures,” Ms Schnabel warned, adding that further increases in the  ECB 's key policy rates will be needed. However, she noted that for now, “the risks of a wage-price spiral are contained, provided inflation expectations remain anchored.”   \n",

In August, euro area inflation, as measured by the harmonised consumer price index, was 9.1%, and last September it was 3.4%. Record price growth and the fact that inflation is now expressed in double digits in Germany mean additional pressure on the  ECB  to take measures to control it.  ECB  Governing Council members will meet on 27 October and many experts consider that the  central bank  should continue to be aggressive in the future.  ECB  President  Christine Lagarde  has explicitly confirmed that interest rate hikes are far from over.   \n",

Mr Visco added that he did not think it is appropriate to tie the  ECB ’s hands with extraordinary or extraordinarily high increases, referring to experiences of different countries by type of economy. The trend and target of these hikes is a complicated issue also because, given the delay in the repercussion of monetary policy moves, the  ECB  faces a risk that, by raising interest rates, it could affect output and not inflation, Mr Visco explained. Thus, the Governing Council decided to have a meeting-by-meeting and data-dependent approach, Mr Visco concluded.   \n",

Inflation in the euro area reached double digits for the first time in September, driven by a massive surge in energy prices. According to Ms Schnabel, the  ECB  cannot rely solely on model-based forecasts in an environment characterised by abrupt changes, so the data currently coming in is now of particular importance. She added that further policy rate increases are necessary.    \n",

       "18  The monetary policy normalisation will have to continue with the aim of gradually reabsorbing the large accommodation created since 2014 when inflation was very low, Banca d’Italia Governor  Ignazio Visco  said in a speech organised by the Florence School of Banking and Finance. The  ECB  Governing Council faces a dilemma given that the increase in inflation is now accompanied by a sharp deterioration in the economic growth outlook, Mr Visco added, stressing that in this context, excessively rapid and pronounced interest rate hikes would end up increasing the risks of a recession. According to him, if the deterioration in the economic outlook turns out to be worse than expected, excessive anticipation in the normalisation of official interest rates could be disproportionate, undermining public confidence in the  ECB ’s actions and making it more difficult to maintain price stability over the medium term. It is a risk that deserves careful consideration along with letting inflation remain excessively high for too long, Mr Visco concluded.   \n",

And the dust of the hawks' front is soaked in the ECB Council: There is no <<obvious reason why Tying Our Hands With Hypotheses of Extraordinarily High Increases Such as Those We Read in Some Parts. A Speech Made Highlighting the Difference Between Europe and the United States which requires a different normalization path. A similar vision is also expressed by the EU Commissioner for Economic Affairs Paolo Gentiloni who calls for fighting inflation \"without killing growth\". For the board of the central bank, a decision will also be made more difficult by the different pace of inflation in European countries, hidden within 10% of the EU figure. If Germany is at 10%, LANDA at 17% and Italy at 8.9%, in Spain prices are rising and so also in France, at +6.2%. In his speech, the Governor claims that the ECB has made its path neither accommodative nor restrictive and that Frankfurt is trying to achieve so as not to further fan the flames of inflation: 'It would be in a range between 0.7 and no rate hike. , orClose to Be Soon >>. Visco's is a clear stop to colleagues who are asking for new sharp increases in GNI. Decision will be made \"based on data\". In the last two days alone, the governors of Austria, Finland, Lithuania and Latvia had pushed the hawkish front in favor of a 75 basis point squeeze in October.

The message, without naming it, is to the new government.

TASR informs about it on the basis of the report of the DPA agency. \"Rising inflation now goes hand in hand with a sudden worsening of growth prospects,\" said Visco, who is a member of the Board of Governors of the European Central Bank. \"In this situation, too fast and too aggressive an increase in rates increases the risk of recession.\" The majority of ECB officials signaled that they continue to support the rapid tightening of monetary policy. Many are calling for another rate hike of 75 basis points. However, according to Visco, the ECB must not rely too much on other central banks and reduce its room for maneuver. \"The assumption that the ECB will blindly follow the US Fed in the coming months can be a very wrong estimate.\" The ECB has increased its key rate this year by a total of 1.25 percentage points. The US central bank, the Fed, has already raised rates by a total of 3 percentage points The reason for the tightening of monetary policies is high inflation.   \n",

However, the statements of ECB Council member Ignazio Visco could now provide some calm on the stock markets. On Friday, the governor of the Italian central bank warned against excessive key interest rate increases Through the European Central Bank (ECB). “The rising inflation is now accompanied by a sudden deterioration in the economic growth prospects,” said Visco, who also helps determine monetary policy in the ECB Council, on Friday in Florence. “Against this background, rapid and significant interest rate increases increase the risk of a recession. \" The ECB has raised its key interest rate by a total of 1.25 percentage points this year. The Fed, on the other hand, has already raised its interest rates by 3.00 percentage points. At their most recent meetings, both central banks increased their key interest rates by 0.75 percentage points each. Recently, numerous ECB representatives had spoken out in favor of further significant interest rate increases. A further increase of 0.75 percentage points was often specifically advocated. According to Visco, the ECB must not orient itself too much towards other central banks and limit certain options for action. \"The assumption that \"If the ECB blindly follows the Fed in the coming months, it could be a serious miscalculation.\" If interest rates rise less sharply than feared, this will be positive for the stock market. Background: When key and bond interest rates rise, fixed-interest securities become more attractive, while stocks lose this due to the higher risk. In addition, companies can raise money more easily when interest rates are lower However, investors should note one thing: Visco is considered a monetary policy dove by experts. He is therefore already cautious about tightening monetary policy. With material from DPA-AFX.   \n",

Not\\\\n one can in fact ignore the redistributive and allocative consequences of\\\\n what happens on the energy front\".\\\\n \\\\n   \"If, however, it were decided to make redistribution weigh above all\\\\n on future generations essentially with the issuance of debt\\\\n public, there would be a risk of burdening the latter with unfair burdens and\\\\n further fuel current and expected inflation. For Italy, that is\\\\n it would also carry the risk of derailing public debt from\\\\n return journey, in relation to the product, which began last year\\\\n year, a necessary path to preserve the possibility of returning to\\\\n strong and lasting economic growth\", he concluded.\\\\n reverse\\\\n \\\\n (end)\\\\n \\\\n MF-DJ NEWS   \n",

This was underlined by the Governor of the Florence School of Banking and Finance, observing that \"in this context, excessively rapid and pronounced rate rises would end up increasing the risks of a recession\". Worse Than Expected - Observe - An excessive advance in the normalization of rates in our shares and would paradoxically make it more difficult to maintain price stability in the medium term. It is a risk that deserves to be carefully considered together with that of letting inflation remains excessively high for too long.\"   \n",

       "      <td>MARRAKECH, Oct 11 (Reuters) - The European Central Bank should discuss tweaks to a key bond buying scheme and weigh higher charges for commercial banks, Latvian policymaker Martins Kazaks said on Wednesday, arguing a recent rise in borrowing costs, including for Italy, was not worrisome. Some investors were spooked by market volatility in recent weeks that pushed up the premium Italy must pay to borrow, and said the turbulence was a lesson for the ECB to stick with a scheme that forms a key plank in fighting off unexpected yield rises. But Kazaks said the move was merely a reflection of Italy's widening budget deficit and this should not stop the ECB from debating an early end to its reinvestments in the 1.7 trillion euro ($1.8 trillion) Pandemic Emergency Purchase Programme (PEPP). \"With regard to Italy, at least at the current stage, I don't see anything that worries me about an impairment in the transmission mechanism or something that I would consider an unwarranted market reaction,\" Kazaks told Reuters. The ECB uses reinvestments in the PEPP scheme with a degree of flexibility, skewing purchases towards more indebted countries when warranted in what some policymakers call the bank's first line of defence. The ECB is set to reinvest all proceeds from the scheme until the end of 2024 but some have called for an earlier end, given that the bank has been tightening policy to fight inflation. \"I would say that we would gain credibility by adjusting instruments and explaining this, rather than sticking to an instrument for too long,\" Kazaks said. \"Do I think it's necessary or possible to end reinvestments earlier than the end of next year? My answer would be yes.\" However, any further reduction in excess liquidity should be gradual and predictable, so changes to PEPP should not be abrupt, he argued. Kazaks also said the ECB should revisit increasing the mandatory reserve requirement for commercial banks, which would force lenders to park more cash at the central bank with no interest. Policymakers considered this option over the summer and decided against it, but some hope the issue would come back when the ECB reviews its broader operational framework early next year. \"This is an instrument that has been used in the past regularly,\" Kazaks said. \"There is a case to be discussed ... I think a larger multiple would be a discussion point.\" But Kazaks played down the prospects of further interest rate hikes, arguing that communication at the ECB should now shift to the duration of high rates from further increases. \"I think interest rate levels are quite appropriate for us to get back to 2% inflation in the second half of 2025,\" he said. \"But I cannot shut the door to a further rate increase sometimes down the road.\" ($1 = 0.9423 euros)</td>\n",

       "      <td>Trying to fight or reach already 4%. Euribor increases not only delaying new loans, but also affects previously issued loans. According to the Collected Data of the Finance Industry Association, a rapid increase in the amount of interest payments is rare for customers and for the most part. Sometimes, for those whose increase is large, the Bank offers to restructure the loan. The increase in Euribor significantly increases the Bank's income and also the profit. Most likely, it will be taxed with the company income tax already next year, which has brought an additional 140 million EUR to the state budget. Therefore, the borrowers will not see any benefit from this in their wallets, so the policy has decided to force the banks to reduce interest rates, which in Latvia It is one of the highest in Europe. The bank loan rate offer is prepared by the bank itself and submitted to the agreed frankfurt. The President of the Bank of Latvia, martins Kazaks, who is also a member of the Council of the European Central Bank, asserts that the Aprekins Risk Component is not imposed by the regulator and the Bank's policy. The head of the Monetary Policy Management Board of the Bank of Latvia said on the sidelines of the box office broadcast that Banks do not want to take risks. \"The risk of commercial banks' balance sheets is among the lowest in the entire European Union. Through the entire crisis, the bank's customers' payment performance has been valued by us, as if these customers were very risky,\" said Rutkaste. Tomer, the pressure of the Bank's policy to reduce rates is called populism, which goes against the policy of the European Central Bank. It is seen that nothing new has happened, because the credit institutions already have the tools to help their customers. The budget of the Saeima and the Finance Commission are choosing a more decisive solution. Therefore, last week they asked the Ministry of Finance to develop a new law that would reduce bank interest rates by half for two years. Edgars Pastars, the senior legal advisor of the Financial Industry Association, indicated that banks could take such a \"risky step\", but it is seen to have more negative long-term consequences. However, a similar step has already been taken by Poland, where there will be no interest rates for loans for four months of the year. Elsewhere, Agreements with Banks Have Happened in Good Practices, For example, Credit Institutions in Greece have reduced their rates by 0.2%. The situation in Latvia is such a small reduction, but it does not leave a noticeable impact. The attitude of the Kazakh Insight Banks has so far been somewhat reluctant, somewhat reluctant, so, in other words, administrative solutions would be very adequate. Tomer Pastars Emphasizes That Currently, Populism and Raised Tone are Governing the Negotiations, Not Constructive Cooperation. If the Saeima Decides Compulsory Card Regulates Bank Credit Prices, Then the Finance Association warns that the Dala ispar. Rutkaste believes that Sadi Draudi is not taken seriously. Sonedel, by order of the Cabinet of Ministers, a working group has been established, which presents its solution to help the poor with mortgage credit. The prevailing mood shows that the Saeima Budget Commission Chairman Jana Reira (JV) does not support the Upcoming Radical Solution of the Saeima. This can be said, because the experts does not rule out that the stagnation of the Sozis can be modeled by the recession. In that case, the pressure of the society will also increase. It is known that the Saeima's Budget and Finance (Tax) Commission invited the Ministry of Finance (FM) for the protection of credit defaulters on Wednesday, the head of the commission said at the meeting. The head of the commission stated that the best solution would be a separate law with some articles and not, for example, amendments to the Consumer Rights Protection Law or the Credit Law. The Sadu solution was also supported by the FM and the legal office of the Saeima.</td>\n",

The  ECB 's new indicator suggests that wage growth, which ended the year at around 3.8% year-on-year, will continue to rise in the coming months, possibly exceeding 5%, posing a threat to the  ECB 's ability to curb inflationary growth in the coming months. The market is currently expecting the  ECB  to cut rates by 25 basis points in April, but the  ECB 's official message suggests that the move will come later. Latvijas Banka Governor  Mārtiņš Kazāks  emphasised that \"the worst mistake the  ECB  could make would be to cut rates too soon\".</td>\n",

       "      <td>One of the greatest dangers that jeopardizes compliance with the inflation target of the European Central Bank (ECB) is the evolution of salaries in the Old Continent, the feared second round effect. The possibility of an inflationary spiral being formed due to wage increases, as workers negotiate better conditions to combat the increase in the cost of living, is something that the ECB wants to avoid at all costs. In order to monitor the evolution of salaries more closely, the organization has developed a new advance salary indicator with which they will be able to measure the pulse of the salary negotiations that are taking place. The first reading of the new salary index is not flattering: it indicates that the ceiling in salary increases has not yet been reached, something that could generate inflationary spikes and delay the moment in which the organization will begin to lower interest rates in the eurozone. The last effort to moderate inflation, from the current around 3% to the 2% at which the ECB's objective is maintained, is the most complicated to achieve. Many analysts, such as Hussain Mehdi, head of asset allocation at HSBC AM, warn of this possibility: \"2023 was very good at reducing inflation, but that was the easy part of the process. The last step is the most difficult going down, and the market is assuming a lot of good news,\" he explained to elEconomista.es in an interview at the end of January. The economy runs the risk, as has already happened in the past in other geographies, that the increase in prices generates wage increases, and these, in turn, trigger prices even more, fueling new increases in wages, and so on. successively, a situation of whiting that bites its tail from which it is very difficult to get out once it starts. Monitoring the progress of salaries is now of capital importance for the ECB, and hence the need to have the most appropriate indicators to be able to study the situation quickly. \"The new wage indicators for the euro zone are based on a new database of negotiations and agreements on wages,\" explains the organization. \"It highlights how these innovative indicators closely follow wage negotiations, and offer reliable signals of how wages are developing,\" says the central bank. The problem for the ECB is that, according to this new indicator, everything indicates that the wage increase is not going to slow down in the short term. If workers' payrolls closed the year with a growth of around 3.8% year-on-year, the ECB index indicates that it will continue to increase in the coming months, even exceeding 5%. This poses a threat to the agency being able to rein in inflationary growth in the coming months. As the ECB itself explains, \"the collective bargaining agreements seen at the end of 2023 do not show a clear indication that there will be a turning point in wage negotiations, and the long average duration of contracts in some countries could generate persistence in the strong wage growth that is taking place,\" explains the ECB. The rebound in salaries anticipated by the new ECB indicator also includes the increase that salaries will experience including one-off payments, a metric that includes one-time payments, such as extraordinary payments, or payments that can be made, for example, to self-employed workers for a specific project. The indicator that includes single payments will end up growing at a lower rate than the one that does not include them, according to the projections released by the ECB. The market is buying now that the ECB will cut rates by 25 basis points in April, but the official message from the organization suggests that the movement will come later, since they are in no hurry in this regard, and prefer to make sure that the situation is well channeled rather than risk making a monetary policy error. The last official interest rate meeting left this message from the organization, and subsequently several members of the Governing Council have launched messages calling for caution. Martins Kazaks, for example, has highlighted that \"the ECB's worst mistake would be to cut rates too soon\", and recalls that \"the past indicates that, if you start to relax prematurely, inflation returns, and in the end it forces you to have to raise rates much more.\"</td>\n",

       "33690  The  ECB  should discuss tweaks to a key bond-buying scheme and weigh higher charges for commercial banks, Latvijas Banka Governor  Mārtiņš Kazāks  said on Wednesday, arguing a recent rise in borrowing costs, including for Italy, was not worrisome. He said the move was merely a reflection of Italy's widening budget deficit and this should not stop the  ECB  from debating an early end to its reinvestments in the  PEPP . Further reduction in excess liquidity through adjustments in the  PEPP  should be gradual and predictable, so changes to the  programme  should not be abrupt, Mr Kazāks argued. He also said the  ECB  should revisit increasing the mandatory reserve requirement for commercial banks, adding that “a larger multiple would be a discussion point.” Mr Kazāks also played down the prospects of further interest rate hikes, saying that current levels are “quite appropriate” and arguing that communication at the  ECB  should now shift to the duration of high rates from further increases.   \n",

Such an account could be used by low-risk business operators and aims to provide simplified access to financial services in cases where companies need to make payments only within the  EU /EEA. As Latvijas Banka Governor  Mārtiņš Kazāks  explains, unfortunately, some of the non-risky companies are often subject to the same procedures as those operating in risky markets, which is not proportionate or appropriate.   \n",

In an attempt to combat very high inflation, the  ECB  has been increasing the interbank interest rate for a long time. The banks' loan rate offers are prepared by the banks themselves and submitted to Frankfurt for approval. Latvijas Banka Governor  Mārtiņš Kazāks  said the risk component calculation is not imposed by the regulator and is the banks' own policy. In the banks' view, there is no need to introduce anything new, as credit institutions already have the tools to help their customers. For Mr Kazāks, the banks' behaviour so far has been rather reluctant, rather sluggish, so administrative solutions would be adequate.   \n",

Now, inflation in  Europe  is falling, but it is still far from the 2% target. The rise in Euribor significantly increased banks' income and profits. However, the offer of lending rates is prepared by the bank itself and submitted to Frankfurt for approval. Latvijas Banka Governor  Mārtiņš Kazāks  said the risk component calculation is not imposed by the regulator and is the banks' own policy. The banks called the sudden pressure from politicians to cut rates populism, which goes against the policy of the  ECB . In their view, there is no need to introduce anything new, as credit institutions already have the tools to help their customers.   \n",

HSBC AM Head of Asset Allocation Hussain Mehdi warned that the final effort to moderate inflation from around 3% to the  ECB 's target of 2% is the most challenging. The  ECB 's new indicator suggests that wage growth, which ended the year at around 3.8% year-on-year, will continue to rise in the coming months, possibly exceeding 5%, posing a threat to the  ECB 's ability to curb inflationary growth in the coming months. The market is currently expecting the  ECB  to cut rates by 25 basis points in April, but the  ECB 's official message suggests that the move will come later. Latvijas Banka Governor  Mārtiņš Kazāks  emphasised that \"the worst mistake the  ECB  could make would be to cut rates too soon\".   \n",

Consumer prices surged 10% from a year ago in September, data from Eurostat showed Friday. That’s more than the median forecast of 9.7% in a Bloomberg survey of economists, and marks the fifth straight month the result has exceeded consensus.   \n",

Some investors were spooked by market volatility in recent weeks that pushed up the premium Italy must pay to borrow, and said the turbulence was a lesson for the ECB to stick with a scheme that forms a key plank in fighting off unexpected yield rises. But Kazaks said the move was merely a reflection of Italy's widening budget deficit and this should not stop the ECB from debating an early end to its reinvestments in the 1.7 trillion euro ($1.8 trillion) Pandemic Emergency Purchase Programme (PEPP). \"With regard to Italy, at least at the current stage, I don't see anything that worries me about an impairment in the transmission mechanism or something that I would consider an unwarranted market reaction,\" Kazaks told Reuters. The ECB uses reinvestments in the PEPP scheme with a degree of flexibility, skewing purchases towards more indebted countries when warranted in what some policymakers call the bank's first line of defence. The ECB is set to reinvest all proceeds from the scheme until the end of 2024 but some have called for an earlier end, given that the bank has been tightening policy to fight inflation. \"I would say that we would gain credibility by adjusting instruments and explaining this, rather than sticking to an instrument for too long,\" Kazaks said. \"Do I think it's necessary or possible to end reinvestments earlier than the end of next year? My answer would be yes.\" However, any further reduction in excess liquidity should be gradual and predictable, so changes to PEPP should not be abrupt, he argued. Kazaks also said the ECB should revisit increasing the mandatory reserve requirement for commercial banks, which would force lenders to park more cash at the central bank with no interest. Policymakers considered this option over the summer and decided against it, but some hope the issue would come back when the ECB reviews its broader operational framework early next year. \"This is an instrument that has been used in the past regularly,\" Kazaks said. \"There is a case to be discussed ... I think a larger multiple would be a discussion point.\" But Kazaks played down the prospects of further interest rate hikes, arguing that communication at the ECB should now shift to the duration of high rates from further increases. \"I think interest rate levels are quite appropriate for us to get back to 2% inflation in the second half of 2025,\" he said. \"But I cannot shut the door to a further rate increase sometimes down the road.\" ($1 = 0.9423 euros)   \n",

Euribor increases not only delaying new loans, but also affects previously issued loans. According to the Collected Data of the Finance Industry Association, a rapid increase in the amount of interest payments is rare for customers and for the most part. Sometimes, for those whose increase is large, the Bank offers to restructure the loan. The increase in Euribor significantly increases the Bank's income and also the profit. Most likely, it will be taxed with the company income tax already next year, which has brought an additional 140 million EUR to the state budget. Therefore, the borrowers will not see any benefit from this in their wallets, so the policy has decided to force the banks to reduce interest rates, which in Latvia It is one of the highest in Europe. The bank loan rate offer is prepared by the bank itself and submitted to the agreed frankfurt. The President of the Bank of Latvia, martins Kazaks, who is also a member of the Council of the European Central Bank, asserts that the Aprekins Risk Component is not imposed by the regulator and the Bank's policy. The head of the Monetary Policy Management Board of the Bank of Latvia said on the sidelines of the box office broadcast that Banks do not want to take risks. \"The risk of commercial banks' balance sheets is among the lowest in the entire European Union. Through the entire crisis, the bank's customers' payment performance has been valued by us, as if these customers were very risky,\" said Rutkaste. Tomer, the pressure of the Bank's policy to reduce rates is called populism, which goes against the policy of the European Central Bank. It is seen that nothing new has happened, because the credit institutions already have the tools to help their customers. The budget of the Saeima and the Finance Commission are choosing a more decisive solution. Therefore, last week they asked the Ministry of Finance to develop a new law that would reduce bank interest rates by half for two years. Edgars Pastars, the senior legal advisor of the Financial Industry Association, indicated that banks could take such a \"risky step\", but it is seen to have more negative long-term consequences. However, a similar step has already been taken by Poland, where there will be no interest rates for loans for four months of the year. Elsewhere, Agreements with Banks Have Happened in Good Practices, For example, Credit Institutions in Greece have reduced their rates by 0.2%. The situation in Latvia is such a small reduction, but it does not leave a noticeable impact. The attitude of the Kazakh Insight Banks has so far been somewhat reluctant, somewhat reluctant, so, in other words, administrative solutions would be very adequate. Tomer Pastars Emphasizes That Currently, Populism and Raised Tone are Governing the Negotiations, Not Constructive Cooperation. If the Saeima Decides Compulsory Card Regulates Bank Credit Prices, Then the Finance Association warns that the Dala ispar. Rutkaste believes that Sadi Draudi is not taken seriously. Sonedel, by order of the Cabinet of Ministers, a working group has been established, which presents its solution to help the poor with mortgage credit. The prevailing mood shows that the Saeima Budget Commission Chairman Jana Reira (JV) does not support the Upcoming Radical Solution of the Saeima. This can be said, because the experts does not rule out that the stagnation of the Sozis can be modeled by the recession. In that case, the pressure of the society will also increase. It is known that the Saeima's Budget and Finance (Tax) Commission invited the Ministry of Finance (FM) for the protection of credit defaulters on Wednesday, the head of the commission said at the meeting. The head of the commission stated that the best solution would be a separate law with some articles and not, for example, amendments to the Consumer Rights Protection Law or the Credit Law. The Sadu solution was also supported by the FM and the legal office of the Saeima.   \n",

       "34638  One of the greatest dangers that jeopardizes compliance with the inflation target of the European Central Bank (ECB) is the evolution of salaries in the Old Continent, the feared second round effect. The possibility of an inflationary spiral being formed due to wage increases, as workers negotiate better conditions to combat the increase in the cost of living, is something that the ECB wants to avoid at all costs. In order to monitor the evolution of salaries more closely, the organization has developed a new advance salary indicator with which they will be able to measure the pulse of the salary negotiations that are taking place. The first reading of the new salary index is not flattering: it indicates that the ceiling in salary increases has not yet been reached, something that could generate inflationary spikes and delay the moment in which the organization will begin to lower interest rates in the eurozone. The last effort to moderate inflation, from the current around 3% to the 2% at which the ECB's objective is maintained, is the most complicated to achieve. Many analysts, such as Hussain Mehdi, head of asset allocation at HSBC AM, warn of this possibility: \"2023 was very good at reducing inflation, but that was the easy part of the process. The last step is the most difficult going down, and the market is assuming a lot of good news,\" he explained to elEconomista.es in an interview at the end of January. The economy runs the risk, as has already happened in the past in other geographies, that the increase in prices generates wage increases, and these, in turn, trigger prices even more, fueling new increases in wages, and so on. successively, a situation of whiting that bites its tail from which it is very difficult to get out once it starts. Monitoring the progress of salaries is now of capital importance for the ECB, and hence the need to have the most appropriate indicators to be able to study the situation quickly. \"The new wage indicators for the euro zone are based on a new database of negotiations and agreements on wages,\" explains the organization. \"It highlights how these innovative indicators closely follow wage negotiations, and offer reliable signals of how wages are developing,\" says the central bank. The problem for the ECB is that, according to this new indicator, everything indicates that the wage increase is not going to slow down in the short term. If workers' payrolls closed the year with a growth of around 3.8% year-on-year, the ECB index indicates that it will continue to increase in the coming months, even exceeding 5%. This poses a threat to the agency being able to rein in inflationary growth in the coming months. As the ECB itself explains, \"the collective bargaining agreements seen at the end of 2023 do not show a clear indication that there will be a turning point in wage negotiations, and the long average duration of contracts in some countries could generate persistence in the strong wage growth that is taking place,\" explains the ECB. The rebound in salaries anticipated by the new ECB indicator also includes the increase that salaries will experience including one-off payments, a metric that includes one-time payments, such as extraordinary payments, or payments that can be made, for example, to self-employed workers for a specific project. The indicator that includes single payments will end up growing at a lower rate than the one that does not include them, according to the projections released by the ECB. The market is buying now that the ECB will cut rates by 25 basis points in April, but the official message from the organization suggests that the movement will come later, since they are in no hurry in this regard, and prefer to make sure that the situation is well channeled rather than risk making a monetary policy error. The last official interest rate meeting left this message from the organization, and subsequently several members of the Governing Council have launched messages calling for caution. Martins Kazaks, for example, has highlighted that \"the ECB's worst mistake would be to cut rates too soon\", and recalls that \"the past indicates that, if you start to relax prematurely, inflation returns, and in the end it forces you to have to raise rates much more.\"   \n",

      "0                            At a conference in Florence, Banca d'Italia Governor  Ignazio Visco  warned of the risks of triggering recession if the  ECB  blindly follows the US Federal Reserve and proceeds with excessively rapid and pronounced rate rises. Mr Visco, however, defended the  ECB  from the attacks of those who criticised it as slow in recognising the arrival of high inflation in recent months and stressed that he does not see any apparent reason to assume that the upcoming increases will be extraordinarily high. The governor claimed that the  ECB  had started its journey last December and emphasised that the institution's neutral policy rate would be between 0.7% and 1.8%. Therefore, the  ECB  could have already reached this rate with its last interest rate increase or is close to reaching it soon.   \n",

      "4  ECB  Executive Board Member  Isabel Schnabel  said Friday that even an economic slowdown in  Europe  may not be enough to tame inflation, urging more increases in borrowing costs. Uncertainty about the persistence of price pressures continues to call for a “robust control” approach to monetary policy, Ms Schnabel said in a speech in Spain. Such a stance reduces the danger that medium- and long-term inflation expectations move further away from the 2% target, she said. “A decline in real wages and a slowdown in aggregate demand may not materially ease current inflationary pressures,” Ms Schnabel warned, adding that further increases in the  ECB 's key policy rates will be needed. However, she noted that for now, “the risks of a wage-price spiral are contained, provided inflation expectations remain anchored.”   \n",

After the hail of declarations from the hawks, the Frankfurt leadership in recent days was slow in recognizing the arrival of high inflation in recent months. And the dust of the hawks' front is soaked in the ECB Council: There is no <<obvious reason why Tying Our Hands With Hypotheses of Extraordinarily High Increases Such as Those We Read in Some Parts. A Speech Made Highlighting the Difference Between Europe and the United States which requires a different normalization path. A similar vision is also expressed by the EU Commissioner for Economic Affairs Paolo Gentiloni who calls for fighting inflation \"without killing growth\". For the board of the central bank, a decision will also be made more difficult by the different pace of inflation in European countries, hidden within 10% of the EU figure. If Germany is at 10%, LANDA at 17% and Italy at 8.9%, in Spain prices are rising and so also in France, at +6.2%. In his speech, the Governor claims that the ECB has made its path neither accommodative nor restrictive and that Frankfurt is trying to achieve so as not to further fan the flames of inflation: 'It would be in a range between 0.7 and no rate hike. , orClose to Be Soon >>. Visco's is a clear stop to colleagues who are asking for new sharp increases in GNI. Decision will be made \"based on data\". In the last two days alone, the governors of Austria, Finland, Lithuania and Latvia had pushed the hawkish front in favor of a 75 basis point squeeze in October. IT'S NOT ONLY GROWTH THAT IS VANTI'S TROUBLE FOR FINANCIAL STABILITY>>, the realization of which would have heavy repercussions in all the countries of the euro area, leading to a tightening of financial conditions far greater than what was considered appropriate to contain the high inflation. \"And also for this reason Italy must not abdicate its virtuous path on which Mario Draghi's government has set out: debt reduction.

TASR informs about it on the basis of the report of the DPA agency. \"Rising inflation now goes hand in hand with a sudden worsening of growth prospects,\" said Visco, who is a member of the Board of Governors of the European Central Bank. \"In this situation, too fast and too aggressive an increase in rates increases the risk of recession.\" The majority of ECB officials signaled that they continue to support the rapid tightening of monetary policy. Many are calling for another rate hike of 75 basis points. However, according to Visco, the ECB must not rely too much on other central banks and reduce its room for maneuver. \"The assumption that the ECB will blindly follow the US Fed in the coming months can be a very wrong estimate.\" The ECB has increased its key rate this year by a total of 1.25 percentage points. The US central bank, the Fed, has already raised rates by a total of 3 percentage points The reason for the tightening of monetary policies is high inflation.   \n",

Uncertainty about the persistence of price pressures continues to call for a “robust control” approach to monetary policy, Schnabel said Friday in a speech in Spain. Such a stance reduces the danger that medium- and long-term inflation expectations move further away from the 2% target, she said.   \n",

Mr Visco, however, defended the  ECB  from the attacks of those who criticised it as slow in recognising the arrival of high inflation in recent months and stressed that he does not see any apparent reason to assume that the upcoming increases will be extraordinarily high. The governor claimed that the  ECB  had started its journey last December and emphasised that the institution's neutral policy rate would be between 0.7% and 1.8%. Therefore, the  ECB  could have already reached this rate with its last interest rate increase or is close to reaching it soon.</td>\n",

       "      <td>No to an excessive rise in rates. The Governor of the Bank of Italy, Vincenzo Visco, warns against rapid and pronounced risks &gt;&gt;. After the hail of declarations from the hawks, the Frankfurt leadership in recent days was slow in recognizing the arrival of high inflation in recent months. And the dust of the hawks' front is soaked in the ECB Council: There is no &lt;&lt;obvious reason why Tying Our Hands With Hypotheses of Extraordinarily High Increases Such as Those We Read in Some Parts. A Speech Made Highlighting the Difference Between Europe and the United States which requires a different normalization path. A similar vision is also expressed by the EU Commissioner for Economic Affairs Paolo Gentiloni who calls for fighting inflation \"without killing growth\". For the board of the central bank, a decision will also be made more difficult by the different pace of inflation in European countries, hidden within 10% of the EU figure. If Germany is at 10%, LANDA at 17% and Italy at 8.9%, in Spain prices are rising and so also in France, at +6.2%. In his speech, the Governor claims that the ECB has made its path neither accommodative nor restrictive and that Frankfurt is trying to achieve so as not to further fan the flames of inflation: 'It would be in a range between 0.7 and no rate hike. , orClose to Be Soon &gt;&gt;. Visco's is a clear stop to colleagues who are asking for new sharp increases in GNI. Decision will be made \"based on data\". In the last two days alone, the governors of Austria, Finland, Lithuania and Latvia had pushed the hawkish front in favor of a 75 basis point squeeze in October. IT'S NOT ONLY GROWTH THAT IS VANTI'S TROUBLE FOR FINANCIAL STABILITY&gt;&gt;, the realization of which would have heavy repercussions in all the countries of the euro area, leading to a tightening of financial conditions far greater than what was considered appropriate to contain the high inflation. \"And also for this reason Italy must not abdicate its virtuous path on which Mario Draghi's government has set out: debt reduction. The message, without naming it, is to the new government. Help to combat the energy shock and the expensive bills are possible but only to the most affected companies and families, otherwise the Count will be paid by future generations with the Greater Kingdom.</td>\n",

Many are calling for another rate hike of 75 basis points. However, according to Visco, the ECB must not rely too much on other central banks and reduce its room for maneuver. \"The assumption that the ECB will blindly follow the US Fed in the coming months can be a very wrong estimate.\" The ECB has increased its key rate this year by a total of 1.25 percentage points.

       "      <td>The fear of an approaching recession and further rising interest rates has recently put the stock markets under significant pressure. However, the statements of ECB Council member Ignazio Visco could now provide some calm on the stock markets. On Friday, the governor of the Italian central bank warned against excessive key interest rate increases Through the European Central Bank (ECB). “The rising inflation is now accompanied by a sudden deterioration in the economic growth prospects,” said Visco, who also helps determine monetary policy in the ECB Council, on Friday in Florence. “Against this background, rapid and significant interest rate increases increase the risk of a recession. \" The ECB has raised its key interest rate by a total of 1.25 percentage points this year. The Fed, on the other hand, has already raised its interest rates by 3.00 percentage points. At their most recent meetings, both central banks increased their key interest rates by 0.75 percentage points each. Recently, numerous ECB representatives had spoken out in favor of further significant interest rate increases. A further increase of 0.75 percentage points was often specifically advocated. According to Visco, the ECB must not orient itself too much towards other central banks and limit certain options for action. \"The assumption that \"If the ECB blindly follows the Fed in the coming months, it could be a serious miscalculation.\" If interest rates rise less sharply than feared, this will be positive for the stock market. Background: When key and bond interest rates rise, fixed-interest securities become more attractive, while stocks lose this due to the higher risk. In addition, companies can raise money more easily when interest rates are lower However, investors should note one thing: Visco is considered a monetary policy dove by experts. He is therefore already cautious about tightening monetary policy. With material from DPA-AFX.</td>\n",

According to him, if the deterioration in the economic outlook turns out to be worse than expected, excessive anticipation in the normalisation of official interest rates could be disproportionate, undermining public confidence in the  ECB ’s actions and making it more difficult to maintain price stability over the medium term.

Mr Visco, however, defended the  ECB  from the attacks of those who criticised it as slow in recognising the arrival of high inflation in recent months and stressed that he does not see any apparent reason to assume that the upcoming increases will be extraordinarily high. The governor claimed that the  ECB  had started its journey last December and emphasised that the institution's neutral policy rate would be between 0.7% and 1.8%. Therefore, the  ECB  could have already reached this rate with its last interest rate increase or is close to reaching it soon.   \n",

Uncertainty about the persistence of price pressures continues to call for a “robust control” approach to monetary policy, Ms Schnabel said in a speech in Spain. Such a stance reduces the danger that medium- and long-term inflation expectations move further away from the 2% target, she said. “A decline in real wages and a slowdown in aggregate demand may not materially ease current inflationary pressures,” Ms Schnabel warned, adding that further increases in the  ECB 's key policy rates will be needed. However, she noted that for now, “the risks of a wage-price spiral are contained, provided inflation expectations remain anchored.”   \n",

In August, euro area inflation, as measured by the harmonised consumer price index, was 9.1%, and last September it was 3.4%. Record price growth and the fact that inflation is now expressed in double digits in Germany mean additional pressure on the  ECB  to take measures to control it.  ECB  Governing Council members will meet on 27 October and many experts consider that the  central bank  should continue to be aggressive in the future.  ECB  President  Christine Lagarde  has explicitly confirmed that interest rate hikes are far from over.   \n",

Mr Visco added that he did not think it is appropriate to tie the  ECB ’s hands with extraordinary or extraordinarily high increases, referring to experiences of different countries by type of economy. The trend and target of these hikes is a complicated issue also because, given the delay in the repercussion of monetary policy moves, the  ECB  faces a risk that, by raising interest rates, it could affect output and not inflation, Mr Visco explained. Thus, the Governing Council decided to have a meeting-by-meeting and data-dependent approach, Mr Visco concluded.   \n",

Inflation in the euro area reached double digits for the first time in September, driven by a massive surge in energy prices. According to Ms Schnabel, the  ECB  cannot rely solely on model-based forecasts in an environment characterised by abrupt changes, so the data currently coming in is now of particular importance. She added that further policy rate increases are necessary.    \n",

       "18  The monetary policy normalisation will have to continue with the aim of gradually reabsorbing the large accommodation created since 2014 when inflation was very low, Banca d’Italia Governor  Ignazio Visco  said in a speech organised by the Florence School of Banking and Finance. The  ECB  Governing Council faces a dilemma given that the increase in inflation is now accompanied by a sharp deterioration in the economic growth outlook, Mr Visco added, stressing that in this context, excessively rapid and pronounced interest rate hikes would end up increasing the risks of a recession. According to him, if the deterioration in the economic outlook turns out to be worse than expected, excessive anticipation in the normalisation of official interest rates could be disproportionate, undermining public confidence in the  ECB ’s actions and making it more difficult to maintain price stability over the medium term. It is a risk that deserves careful consideration along with letting inflation remain excessively high for too long, Mr Visco concluded.   \n",

And the dust of the hawks' front is soaked in the ECB Council: There is no <<obvious reason why Tying Our Hands With Hypotheses of Extraordinarily High Increases Such as Those We Read in Some Parts. A Speech Made Highlighting the Difference Between Europe and the United States which requires a different normalization path. A similar vision is also expressed by the EU Commissioner for Economic Affairs Paolo Gentiloni who calls for fighting inflation \"without killing growth\". For the board of the central bank, a decision will also be made more difficult by the different pace of inflation in European countries, hidden within 10% of the EU figure. If Germany is at 10%, LANDA at 17% and Italy at 8.9%, in Spain prices are rising and so also in France, at +6.2%. In his speech, the Governor claims that the ECB has made its path neither accommodative nor restrictive and that Frankfurt is trying to achieve so as not to further fan the flames of inflation: 'It would be in a range between 0.7 and no rate hike. , orClose to Be Soon >>. Visco's is a clear stop to colleagues who are asking for new sharp increases in GNI. Decision will be made \"based on data\". In the last two days alone, the governors of Austria, Finland, Lithuania and Latvia had pushed the hawkish front in favor of a 75 basis point squeeze in October.

The message, without naming it, is to the new government.

TASR informs about it on the basis of the report of the DPA agency. \"Rising inflation now goes hand in hand with a sudden worsening of growth prospects,\" said Visco, who is a member of the Board of Governors of the European Central Bank. \"In this situation, too fast and too aggressive an increase in rates increases the risk of recession.\" The majority of ECB officials signaled that they continue to support the rapid tightening of monetary policy. Many are calling for another rate hike of 75 basis points. However, according to Visco, the ECB must not rely too much on other central banks and reduce its room for maneuver. \"The assumption that the ECB will blindly follow the US Fed in the coming months can be a very wrong estimate.\" The ECB has increased its key rate this year by a total of 1.25 percentage points. The US central bank, the Fed, has already raised rates by a total of 3 percentage points The reason for the tightening of monetary policies is high inflation.   \n",

However, the statements of ECB Council member Ignazio Visco could now provide some calm on the stock markets. On Friday, the governor of the Italian central bank warned against excessive key interest rate increases Through the European Central Bank (ECB). “The rising inflation is now accompanied by a sudden deterioration in the economic growth prospects,” said Visco, who also helps determine monetary policy in the ECB Council, on Friday in Florence. “Against this background, rapid and significant interest rate increases increase the risk of a recession. \" The ECB has raised its key interest rate by a total of 1.25 percentage points this year. The Fed, on the other hand, has already raised its interest rates by 3.00 percentage points. At their most recent meetings, both central banks increased their key interest rates by 0.75 percentage points each. Recently, numerous ECB representatives had spoken out in favor of further significant interest rate increases. A further increase of 0.75 percentage points was often specifically advocated. According to Visco, the ECB must not orient itself too much towards other central banks and limit certain options for action. \"The assumption that \"If the ECB blindly follows the Fed in the coming months, it could be a serious miscalculation.\" If interest rates rise less sharply than feared, this will be positive for the stock market. Background: When key and bond interest rates rise, fixed-interest securities become more attractive, while stocks lose this due to the higher risk. In addition, companies can raise money more easily when interest rates are lower However, investors should note one thing: Visco is considered a monetary policy dove by experts. He is therefore already cautious about tightening monetary policy. With material from DPA-AFX.   \n",

Not\\\\n one can in fact ignore the redistributive and allocative consequences of\\\\n what happens on the energy front\".\\\\n \\\\n   \"If, however, it were decided to make redistribution weigh above all\\\\n on future generations essentially with the issuance of debt\\\\n public, there would be a risk of burdening the latter with unfair burdens and\\\\n further fuel current and expected inflation. For Italy, that is\\\\n it would also carry the risk of derailing public debt from\\\\n return journey, in relation to the product, which began last year\\\\n year, a necessary path to preserve the possibility of returning to\\\\n strong and lasting economic growth\", he concluded.\\\\n reverse\\\\n \\\\n (end)\\\\n \\\\n MF-DJ NEWS   \n",

This was underlined by the Governor of the Florence School of Banking and Finance, observing that \"in this context, excessively rapid and pronounced rate rises would end up increasing the risks of a recession\". Worse Than Expected - Observe - An excessive advance in the normalization of rates in our shares and would paradoxically make it more difficult to maintain price stability in the medium term. It is a risk that deserves to be carefully considered together with that of letting inflation remains excessively high for too long.\"   \n",

      "33947  Content From Kardex Advertisement With the push of a button, the drop storage that the ambulance needs will be delivered at the right time. - It's all about optimizing the logistical flow in the hospital, says Thomas Larsen at Kardex. The automatic elevator Kardex Shuttle makes it possible to store medical equipment at the height, in a hygienic, effective and safe way. Space is a scarce commodity in hospitals. Each row of beds, drip trays and other equipment takes up space that could be used for the care of patients. In Sweden, there are 2,300 waiting places missing, and in many hospitals patient safety is at risk as a result of the lack of space*. What if the equipment could be stored in a vertical warehouse and automatically transported to the different areas of the hospital? It may seem futuristic, but the solution already exists in some hospitals in the north. Thomas Larsen, Business Development Manager for Hospital Logistics at Kardex, explains: - a Kardex Shuttle Can Be Up To 40 Meters High And Consists Of Different Compartments Where Equipment Or Songs Can Be Installed. THESE COMPARTMENTS ARE STORED IN THE BACKGROUND OF THE SYSTEM You Can Say. Are you an experienced nurse who needs a song for a patient? You press a button , and the system will find a Song and deliver it to you. Can be connected to an existing building The automatic lift can either be drawn into the floor plan for a new hospital, or connected from the outside if it is an existing building. The solution is scalable. MANY HOSPITALS HAVE CHOSEN TO ATTACH ONE SYSTEM FOR SONG AND ADDITIONAL ONE FOR ALL EQUIPMENT. In the case of operating trolleys and the like, the warehouse discharge can be delivered with clean room classification. - The biggest advantages are that you save a lot of space and get access to the equipment when it is needed. In addition, the normal elevators of the hospital need to be used to transport equipment. Another advantage is that you can connect the warehouse with IT solutions so that the equipment can be saved .In addition, you can charge batteries in the system, so that, for example, the EKG feeder is ready to be used immediately when it is picked out, says Thomas Larsen. More room for care at the children's hospital The Children's Hospital In Helsingfors Uses Kardex Solutions For Storing And Retrieving Medical Equipment. In A Film Where Kardex Visits The Hospital Advises The Ambulance Manager That The Purpose Of The Installation Was To Reduce The Storage Space, To Be able To Save The Most Possible Number Of Square Meters TIME SAVING WAS ANOTHER ARGUMENT - Now the staff is free to spend time looking for equipment. Thomas Larsen Reports That Kardex Is Right Now Involved In FIVE LARGE NORDIC Projects, Blend Another In Malmo and In Iceland. - It is my clear hope that more new and remodeling projects in hospitals will include solutions like these, because they are logistical optimization possibilities.

       "      <td>But the list continues to change. The most discussed area remains that of Justice. For Silvio Berlusconi it will go to Forza Italia, to Maria Elisabetta Casellati. BUT FDI KEEPS THE POINT ON NORDIO As Keeper of the Seals and the E L E L ODSENDENE OF THE SENATE TO THE REFORMS. Meanwhile, for the defense Guido Crosetto comes into play. Pieces are lost in the Northern League list: like Agriculture, which the League seems to have definitively given up on. Undersecretary to the Presidency of the Council - Almost Made For A Meloni Faithful, That Is Giovanbattista Fazzolari. Ministry of Economy - the name of Giancarlo Giorgetti (Lega) now seems like a fixed point. Minister of the Interior - The strongest candidate remains the prefect of Rome, Matteo Piandosi (at the Carroccio level), it seems that Salvini has definitively given up on him. Ministry of Ecological Transition - The hypothesis of establishing an energy ministry is at stake here, overcoming the current merger of ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT. The most quoted is the Forza Italia supporter Gilberto Pichetto Fratin. Ministry of Health - Orazio Schillaci, Rector of Tor Vergata, is consolidated among the names ventilated. In Disesa the President of the Red Cross, Francesco Rocca and the Director of the EMA Guido Rasi. Ministry of Defense - probably Andra Guido Croseetto, co-founder of FDI, will be responsible for defense. Ministry of Foreign Affairs - The Poltrona is almost certain to be given to Antonio Tajani, the national coordinator of Forza Italia. Ministry of Justice - The chances of Carlo Nordio, the magistrate elected with FDI, are always on the rise. Even if the game with criminal records is far from over. Ministry of Labor - Marina Calderone, President of the Order of Labor Consultants, is increasingly closer to this role. The Minister of Family and Naturality - it is a new ministry, that of Family and Naturality, thought up and proposed by the League. AMONG the hypothesized new features, a new merging of the Ministry of the Family with that of the Disabled, which the League WANTS TO ENTRUST TO ISABELLA RAUTI.The former magistrate Simonetta Matone also appears to be in the running, in Lega quota. Ministry of education - It seems safe here Giuseppe Valditara, Salvini's legal advisor Ministry of university - This ministry could go to the anatomopathologist and deputy Gloria Saccani Jotti, name proposed by Berlusconi. Ministry of Economic Development - The Name to Bet On It could be that of Adolfo Urso, exponent of the Brothers of Italy and current president of Copasir. Ministry of relations with parliament - the centrist Maurizio Lupi gathers a broad consensus. BUT Luca Ciriani, group leader in the Senate of the Brothers of Italy, would also be on pole. Ministry of Transport and Infrastructure - The Infrastructure Chair should be Northern League, almost made for Matteo Salvini. Ministry of Reforms - Here was the date for a certain Elisabetta Casellati, but if the Keeper of the Seals door has not yet closed, there remains a box to fill. Ministry of Agriculture - With the appointment of Gian Marco Centinaio as vice president of the Senate, the league renounces the Ministry of Agriculture which will go to FDI. AFTER THE HYPOTHESIS of a technician, such as Roberto Berutti, the name of Francesco Lollobrigida, Group Leader, appears to the room. Ministry of Welfare - The name of Luca Ricolfi, one of the technicians invited by Meloni to the party's programmatic conference, had been circulated, but he himself denied the news. Ministry of European Policies - For This Role The name that is going around is that of Raffaele Fitto, co-president of the European Conservatives. Ministry of public administration - should still be a strong name Italy: It would be the fifth ministry (Without portfolio) to match the league. In particular, the name of Anna Maria Bernini is circulating. Ministry of Culture - Cultural Heritage Should Go to FDI: Former RAI Board Member Giampaolo Rossi and Gennaro Sangiuliano erri among those eligible. Ministry of the Sea - The hypothesis of establishing a new Ministry also arises, to which the CEO of Fincantieri Giuseppe Bono or the former President of the Sicilian Region Nello Musumeci could go. Minister of Regional Affairs - The League would like to occupy this box for sports on autonomy. Think of Roberto Calderoli. Minister of Tourism - Daniela Santanche (FDI) remains in the running for tourism.</td>\n",

       "41   But the list continues to change. The most discussed area remains that of Justice. For Silvio Berlusconi it will go to Forza Italia, to Maria Elisabetta Casellati. BUT FDI KEEPS THE POINT ON NORDIO As Keeper of the Seals and the E L E L ODSENDENE OF THE SENATE TO THE REFORMS. Meanwhile, for the defense Guido Crosetto comes into play. Pieces are lost in the Northern League list: like Agriculture, which the League seems to have definitively given up on. Undersecretary to the Presidency of the Council - Almost Made For A Meloni Faithful, That Is Giovanbattista Fazzolari. Ministry of Economy - the name of Giancarlo Giorgetti (Lega) now seems like a fixed point. Minister of the Interior - The strongest candidate remains the prefect of Rome, Matteo Piandosi (at the Carroccio level), it seems that Salvini has definitively given up on him. Ministry of Ecological Transition - The hypothesis of establishing an energy ministry is at stake here, overcoming the current merger of ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT. The most quoted is the Forza Italia supporter Gilberto Pichetto Fratin. Ministry of Health - Orazio Schillaci, Rector of Tor Vergata, is consolidated among the names ventilated. In Disesa the President of the Red Cross, Francesco Rocca and the Director of the EMA Guido Rasi. Ministry of Defense - probably Andra Guido Croseetto, co-founder of FDI, will be responsible for defense. Ministry of Foreign Affairs - The Poltrona is almost certain to be given to Antonio Tajani, the national coordinator of Forza Italia. Ministry of Justice - The chances of Carlo Nordio, the magistrate elected with FDI, are always on the rise. Even if the game with criminal records is far from over. Ministry of Labor - Marina Calderone, President of the Order of Labor Consultants, is increasingly closer to this role. The Minister of Family and Naturality - it is a new ministry, that of Family and Naturality, thought up and proposed by the League. AMONG the hypothesized new features, a new merging of the Ministry of the Family with that of the Disabled, which the League WANTS TO ENTRUST TO ISABELLA RAUTI.The former magistrate Simonetta Matone also appears to be in the running, in Lega quota. Ministry of education - It seems safe here Giuseppe Valditara, Salvini's legal advisor Ministry of university - This ministry could go to the anatomopathologist and deputy Gloria Saccani Jotti, name proposed by Berlusconi. Ministry of Economic Development - The Name to Bet On It could be that of Adolfo Urso, exponent of the Brothers of Italy and current president of Copasir. Ministry of relations with parliament - the centrist Maurizio Lupi gathers a broad consensus. BUT Luca Ciriani, group leader in the Senate of the Brothers of Italy, would also be on pole. Ministry of Transport and Infrastructure - The Infrastructure Chair should be Northern League, almost made for Matteo Salvini. Ministry of Reforms - Here was the date for a certain Elisabetta Casellati, but if the Keeper of the Seals door has not yet closed, there remains a box to fill. Ministry of Agriculture - With the appointment of Gian Marco Centinaio as vice president of the Senate, the league renounces the Ministry of Agriculture which will go to FDI. AFTER THE HYPOTHESIS of a technician, such as Roberto Berutti, the name of Francesco Lollobrigida, Group Leader, appears to the room. Ministry of Welfare - The name of Luca Ricolfi, one of the technicians invited by Meloni to the party's programmatic conference, had been circulated, but he himself denied the news. Ministry of European Policies - For This Role The name that is going around is that of Raffaele Fitto, co-president of the European Conservatives. Ministry of public administration - should still be a strong name Italy: It would be the fifth ministry (Without portfolio) to match the league. In particular, the name of Anna Maria Bernini is circulating. Ministry of Culture - Cultural Heritage Should Go to FDI: Former RAI Board Member Giampaolo Rossi and Gennaro Sangiuliano erri among those eligible. Ministry of the Sea - The hypothesis of establishing a new Ministry also arises, to which the CEO of Fincantieri Giuseppe Bono or the former President of the Sicilian Region Nello Musumeci could go.

      "33947  Content From Kardex Advertisement With the push of a button, the drop storage that the ambulance needs will be delivered at the right time. - It's all about optimizing the logistical flow in the hospital, says Thomas Larsen at Kardex. The automatic elevator Kardex Shuttle makes it possible to store medical equipment at the height, in a hygienic, effective and safe way. Space is a scarce commodity in hospitals. Each row of beds, drip trays and other equipment takes up space that could be used for the care of patients. In Sweden, there are 2,300 waiting places missing, and in many hospitals patient safety is at risk as a result of the lack of space*. What if the equipment could be stored in a vertical warehouse and automatically transported to the different areas of the hospital? It may seem futuristic, but the solution already exists in some hospitals in the north. Thomas Larsen, Business Development Manager for Hospital Logistics at Kardex, explains: - a Kardex Shuttle Can Be Up To 40 Meters High And Consists Of Different Compartments Where Equipment Or Songs Can Be Installed. THESE COMPARTMENTS ARE STORED IN THE BACKGROUND OF THE SYSTEM You Can Say. Are you an experienced nurse who needs a song for a patient? You press a button , and the system will find a Song and deliver it to you. Can be connected to an existing building The automatic lift can either be drawn into the floor plan for a new hospital, or connected from the outside if it is an existing building. The solution is scalable. MANY HOSPITALS HAVE CHOSEN TO ATTACH ONE SYSTEM FOR SONG AND ADDITIONAL ONE FOR ALL EQUIPMENT. In the case of operating trolleys and the like, the warehouse discharge can be delivered with clean room classification. - The biggest advantages are that you save a lot of space and get access to the equipment when it is needed. In addition, the normal elevators of the hospital need to be used to transport equipment. Another advantage is that you can connect the warehouse with IT solutions so that the equipment can be saved .In addition, you can charge batteries in the system, so that, for example, the EKG feeder is ready to be used immediately when it is picked out, says Thomas Larsen. More room for care at the children's hospital The Children's Hospital In Helsingfors Uses Kardex Solutions For Storing And Retrieving Medical Equipment. In A Film Where Kardex Visits The Hospital Advises The Ambulance Manager That The Purpose Of The Installation Was To Reduce The Storage Space, To Be able To Save The Most Possible Number Of Square Meters TIME SAVING WAS ANOTHER ARGUMENT - Now the staff is free to spend time looking for equipment. Thomas Larsen Reports That Kardex Is Right Now Involved In FIVE LARGE NORDIC Projects, Blend Another In Malmo and In Iceland. - It is my clear hope that more new and remodeling projects in hospitals will include solutions like these, because they are logistical optimization possibilities.
